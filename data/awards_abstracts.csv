Collaborative Research: Building Empirically Informed Models of Scientific Search and Progress,"scientific progress is vital for advancing technology, fostering social development, and tackling global issues. research indicates that innovative activity in science is slowing. the causes behind this decline are unknown. addressing this issue is hindered by our limited ability to empirically test how individual scientists make breakthrough discoveries. the researchers draw on the interdisciplinary expertise of a team with deep knowledge in sociology, agent-based modeling, and philosophy of science. by combining both theoretical and empirical studies, this award helps science to further understand the causes of, and solutions to, our declining rate of innovation. by providing a deeper understanding of the factors that drive or hinder innovation, the award informs policies aimed at fostering a more conducive environment for scientific breakthroughs. the supported research uses a novel mixed-method approach, where empirically informed agent-based simulation models are combined with empirical analysis of the scientific record. this allows for a comparison of both internal factors---those related to the structure and dynamics of scientific content---and external factors that operate outside and influence the body of scientific knowledge. internal factors involve the proliferation of scientific knowledge, while external factors encompass funding incentives, pressure to publish, and the challenges of remote collaboration. to increase innovation, it is essential to implement actionable policies that mitigate these factors and guide scientists in their contributions to scientific knowledge."
Collaborative Research: Understanding the Incidence of Market Distortions,"this award funds a research project that combines extremely rich and detailed data with economic theory to study how the burden of market failures is shared in the economy. market failures prevent resources, such as labor and capital, from being used in the places where they are most valuable. while it is known that market failures are a feature of all economies and contribute to income differences across countries, the question of which types of households are affected most by these market failures is much less researched. this project makes progress on this gap by developing tools to connect and analyze multiple datasets that provide an extensive set of links in the economy between households and firms, between both households and firms and the government, and between the firms themselves. understanding which groups benefit and which groups lose out from policies that address such market failures is vital to the design of approaches that maximize the welfare of any nation. the research outcomes could be essential for researchers and decisionmakers in shaping optimal u.s. policies and potentially enhancing the wellbeing of households and businesses. this award funds a research project that develops tools to estimate distortions?markups, markdowns, and taxes that prevents resources being allocated to their best uses?at a highly disaggregated level and trace them to individuals through arbitrary trade, employment, and financial networks. this methodology is applied to administrative data, where the research team can map out the flow of goods and money for the entire economy by linking firm-to-firm networks with firm-to-consumer, firm-to-lender, and firm-to-employee networks alongside ownership registries. these methods reveal how the burden of distortions is shared among households belonging to different regions, demographic groups, skill groups, and income levels. in addition, they enable answers to various questions, such as which distortions do the most to compress and expand the distribution of living standards; what trade-offs are observed in approaches designed to improve the impacts of distortions; and to what degree overlapping distortions necessitate our wide-ranging analysis as opposed to focusing on one specific distortion or sector at a time. the theory and methods are developed in a way that they can be applied to any country with similar data. this project advances knowledge in several ways. first, it operationalizes recent theoretical work on general equilibrium models of heterogeneous agents in distorted economic environments. second, by assembling a complete empirical mapping of economic relationships between agents in an economy, it measures the distributional impact of the main distortions that are present in an economy (those on labor, capital, output, and intermediate inputs) throughout all sectors. this is relevant because studying the impact of reducing distortions in one specific market is influenced by distortions in other markets. thus, to fully assess the trade-offs of reducing distortions, one needs to go beyond specific distortions and specific sectors. the results have the potential to significantly reshape how economists perceive the implications of market distortions and the policies responding to them. by addressing who bears the costs and who benefits from market distortions, a key theme for decisionmakers, the findings of this research could lead to optimal policies related to market failures and enhance the welfare of the u.s. population."
"Collaborative Research: Belief Systems Governing Climate Adaptation Behaviors: Inference, Analysis, and Intervention","this project explores how scientific messages about environmental adaptation shape people?s decisions, especially when their beliefs about the environment, politics, and other issues are closely connected. by examining why some individuals embrace adaptation measures?such as flood-proofing homes or relocating from high-risk areas?while others do not, the project seeks to clarify how these choices can unintentionally deepen social and economic inequalities. in doing so, the project addresses the national interest by improving public understanding of climate risks, fostering more informed decision-making, and promoting inclusive, effective adaptation strategies. the project also advances broader societal goals by training undergraduate researchers, partnering with nonprofit organizations to develop practical outreach methods, and creating software tools that can be used to study belief systems in various contexts. this project develops a new conceptual framework, new methodological tools, and survey-based measurement approach for ?belief networks,? capturing how an individual?s attitudes about topics such as climate, people migration, and social fairness simultaneously influence one another. large-scale surveys in the united states and a case study in virginia will map how these networks vary across partisan, demographic, and socioeconomic groups. the researchers will then design and implement scientific communication experiments to examine how information targeting specific attitudes?and the links among them?affects people?s adaptive capacity and motivation. alongside these empirical studies, the project supports new network science methods to analyze individual-level belief systems at scale, providing computational and statistical tools for extracting, modeling, and comparing complex attitude linkages. by integrating these methodological advances with science communication research, the project offers insights into how scientific information can most effectively encourage robust, evidence-based adaptation decisions."
Collaborative Research: Understanding the Drivers of Exchange Rates through International Asset Prices and Capital Flows,"this award funds a research project examining the factors influencing exchange rates, with a focus on international asset prices and capital flows. understanding the drivers of exchange rates is a central objective of international macroeconomics and finance. exchange rates are key prices affecting the relative cost of imports and exports, as well as the returns to investing in assets abroad. yet exchange rates have long puzzled economists: they are inconsistent with benchmark models in economics and are very difficult to predict. this project makes progress on these puzzles by exploring the relationship between exchange rates and other international asset prices, such as bonds and stocks in different countries, as well as macroeconomic quantities, such as capital flows across borders. this research helps market participants use exchange rates to better understand macroeconomic conditions in the global economy. it also helps decision-makers better understand how monetary and fiscal policies affect exchange rates and thus the broader economy. the research findings could inspire innovative international policy frameworks, improve the well-being of households, businesses, and investors, and reinforce global market activity. this award project explores exchange rates through the lens of general equilibrium models with international capital market frictions. these capital market frictions are reflected in a central role for global arbitrageurs to intermediate capital flows across borders. such models thus allow the researchers to accommodate classic forces that have been thought to drive exchange rates, such as the supply or demand for goods, as well as drivers that have been proposed in more recent research, such as changes in the intermediation capacity of global arbitrageurs. the project includes research to decompose the drivers of the dollar exchange rate versus other advanced economies through the lens of such a model. the co-movements of exchange rates with bond yields, spreads in financial markets, and capital flows suggest a nuanced variance decomposition of exchange rates: at high frequencies, shocks to intermediation capacity play an important role in driving exchange rates, but at low frequencies and overall, demand shocks play the most important role. the project includes further research to understand the sources of demand shocks driving variation in these prices and capital flows. the researchers study the co-movements of exchange rates, bonds, and stocks to differentiate between potential sources of demand shocks. the project also includes research to understand how heterogeneous exposures to demand or intermediation shocks can explain differences in exchange rate behavior across countries. the researchers study how patterns in trade linkages and in net foreign assets give rise to heterogeneous effects of these shocks. the project finally includes research on the propagation of macroeconomic policies through exchange rates. the researchers study whether state-dependence in the effects of foreign exchange rate intervention can account for mixed evidence on its effectiveness in the data. this research could help researchers and decision-makers gain deeper insights into exchange rates and their relationship with international asset prices, capital flows, and other macroeconomic factors, ultimately improving the well-being of the u.s. population and strengthening the country's leadership in international markets."
Collaborative Research: Democratic Accountability and Judicial Legitimacy,"this project tracks citizens? attitudes toward a judicial reform effort and the judiciary as these reforms are implemented, as citizens elect their judges, and as the directly elected judges are seated. the reforms call for the direct election of more than 7,000 of the most important judicial positions in the country. because judicial independence is associated with salutary governmental and economic outcomes, and public support for judicial institutions is a key determinant of judicial independence and influence, this project has implications for understanding how the direct election of judges might bolster or undermine institutional separation of powers, economic development, and broader international relations. most of the accumulated knowledge about the public's support for the judiciary has relied upon surveys asking citizens for their evaluations of hypothetical proposals to reform the country's high court. the reforms that prompt this study provide an opportunity to test theories about the correlates and consequences of public support for courts in an environment where the stakes are real and cross-national comparisons are feasible. tracking public opinion over a four-wave panel survey and analyzing unique survey experiments, this research will address three debates. first, each wave of the survey will reach respondents at a point in the reform implementation that enables researchers to disentangle longstanding theories regarding the determinants of public support for judicial institutions. second, relying on within-respondent, cross-wave comparisons, the pis will evaluate the extent to which the electoral connection affects citizens? legal attitudes about courts and judicial authorities, and their willingness to engage them as a result. third, the pis will assess how the reform---and citizens' responses to it---affect their willingness to obey decisions they do not agree with and to tolerate noncompliance with constitutional authorities' decisions. these outcomes have direct relations to the country's ability to attract international investment and to ensure that the separation of powers balances power across the executive, legislative, and judicial branches of government."
"Collaborative Research: HNDS-R: Altruistic stress, economic networks, and endogenous organizational change","organizations shape and depend on cooperation among members, but the volatility of cooperation can cause organizations to fail. co-operative organizations are especially dependent on cooperation, but also generate unique social benefits. understanding how co-operatives persist on volatile patterns of cooperation can clarify the general role of cooperation in organizational change and survival. this project examines how cooperation dynamics can drive organizational outcomes through a collaboration with a network of consumer co-operatives. the project will benefit participating co-operatives with data-driven organizational health reports, and benefit society at large with a cooperation management toolkit for any type of organization. this research can have profound impacts on the ability of organizations to grow and maintain cooperation and may contribute to strategies for growing cooperation to address pressing societal challenges. the project seeks to improve our understanding of organizational evolution by testing a novel dynamical theory of organizational change based on altruistic stress - the psychological stress of unreciprocated cooperative effort to advance group goals. the research team develops a model of a generic organization, which specifies the relationship between tasks, cooperation, altruistic stress, institutions and organizational outcomes. this model is tested with a rich multilevel organizational dataset. building on a collaboration with a network of consumer co-operatives, the research team combines surveys, behavioral cooperation measures, organizational history data, and complete multi-year economic interaction networks across a large sample of co-operatives in the network. to assess the effect of altruistic stress on organizational change, the research team employs multilevel bayesian analysis. in addition, network methods are used to describe the structural features of cooperation networks associated with organizational tipping points. results will improve our understanding of the mechanisms that drive organizational cooperation, survival, and evolution."
"Collaborative Research: RAPID: Understanding risk communication, protective decision-making, and vulnerability in mountain and inland Southeast communities during Hurricane Helene","as the deadliest u.s. mainland hurricane since katrina, with over 230 fatalities, hurricane helene exposed significant vulnerabilities in hazard warning reception and response within mountain and inland communities in the u.s. southeast. risk perception, warning reception, and response in these communities have been largely understudied, leaving critical gaps in understanding how these populations perceive and react to hurricane-related threats, as most research has focused on coastal areas. this work contributes to reducing losses by improving the understanding of hurricane-related risks within mountain and inland communities, leading to improved and more equitable weather warning and response systems. the findings have the potential to benefit mountain and inland communities, national weather service forecasters, emergency management professionals, and especially under-resourced communities. utilizing decision sciences that integrate social and behavioral sciences with weather hazard practices and policies, this project collects time-sensitive information to identify how households and weather stakeholders (forecasters, emergency managers) in mountain and inland communities received, perceived, and responded to risk information related to hurricane helene. the project then integrates social and behavioral science data with physical and built-environment characteristics using geographic information systems and multivariate modeling to explore how these contextual characteristics and factors may influence warning reception and protective decision making. the research advances fundamental knowledge in: (1) understanding the decision-making context among mountain and inland community households and weather hazard decision makers impacted by hurricane helene; and (2) identifying physical, social, and environmental factors that prevent or support hazard warning reception and protective decisions in mountain and inland communities."
Collaborative Research: RAPID: Elections During Crises: The Effects of Hurricane Helene on Election Administration and Perceptions of Integrity in North Carolina,"hurricane helene, striking the southern united states in late september 2024, caused catastrophic damage to western north carolina. the damage to infrastructure (electricity, water, cell service, roads), displacement of residents, and the prioritization of basic needs for relief efforts may directly affect citizen participation in the voting process. ensuring voter access, security, and an efficient process requires a robust response by government officials and non-governmental organizations. failures to provide these services?or the belief that essential services are lacking?could undermine perceptions that the election results are fair and valid. consequently, developing an understanding of the administrative responses to a disaster, as well as public perceptions during an election period, is critical. because north carolina is a key battleground state in the u.s. presidential election, the impact of the storm raises critical research questions: (1) how will the disaster affect the state's capacity to implement elections and (2) how will the state's responses influence public perceptions of election integrity? these questions are important as the state's ability to quickly address logistical challenges could impact voter turnout and confidence in the election outcome. to analyze helene's impact on election administration, this research project will collect and analyze four kinds of data: post-election survey data from residents of the state; exit poll data from voters at early voting sites and election day polling places; interviews with state and local election officials; and administrative data on the location of polling places, changes due to the disaster, and official election results. by analyzing these data, the research will evaluate how logistical challenges influence administrative responses, voter behavior, and perceptions of integrity. the project will contribute to the development of knowledge in several areas of social science research. it will enhance the understanding of voter behavior, election administration, disaster management, and the implications of crises on policy implementation."
SBP: Collaborative Research: Journeys in World Politics A Mentoring Workshop for Junior Women in International Relations,"this project aims to serve the national need of mitigating the underrepresentation of women in science, and therefore contributes to scientific progress. peer mentorship is one of the most effective avenues to increase the status of women in academia. by providing intense peer-mentorship to junior women scholars of international relations, the project will promote high-quality scholarship and contribute to an increased success of mentored women in academia. the project will promote these goals through the hosting of intense peer-mentorship workshops to foster networks, provide feedback and support, disseminate information, and encourage psychological resilience. the project also tracks the success of peer-mentorship programs through survey research and a collection of data on academic success. studies that have evaluated the status of women in international relations over the past 30 years reveal significant gender gaps on numerous dimensions. the continued under-representation of female scholars at top research institutions and high ranks harms scientific progress. recent research demonstrates that active mentoring, especially through workshops that foster networks, provide feedback and support, disseminate information, and encourage psychological resilience, are among the most promising avenues for change. the journeys in world politics workshop program has mentored young women scholars of international relations (ir) since 2004. the project hosts annual three-day workshops that support 18-20 participants and includes research presentations by junior scholars, feedback from discussants, oral autobiographies by senior scholars, and career and gender discussion sessions involving topics such as networking, work-life balance, and navigating classroom gender dynamics. beyond the workshops, the project maintains an active website and other forms of communication, arranges meetings at conferences, and thereby builds a broad network of women in the entire political science discipline. to track the success of mentorship workshops, the project collects more systematic data to evaluate the mechanisms through which mentoring programs increase long-term success rates for female political scientists."
Collaborative Research: Marriage Market Effects of Strengthening Female Inheritance Rights,"this award funds a research project that tests an economic theory about the unintended consequences of public policy. policies that aim to increase female economic empowerment can improve their economic inclusion, bargaining power in the home, and psychological well-being. however, these policies can have unintended consequences, with parents reallocating resources away from daughters? education, dowry, and lower quality marital spouses. this research project will study the effect of a new system of land records that digitizes and centralizes records on female land inheritance, human capital, and marriage outcomes. the researchers will study the overall welfare effects of strengthening women?s? inheritance and other investments, including education. this research contributes to knowledge by considering the full extent of household decision-making by linking inheritance decisions as closely tied to the other human capital investments. the results of this research will provide inputs into policies to improve women?s inheritance rights around the world. the results will also provide guidance on how to craft more efficient policies that will minimize their unintended consequences. this award funds a research project that studies the unintended consequences of policy reforms. the project exploits the staggered implementation of digitizing land records as well as the timing of household head deaths among agricultural landowning landlords to answer three questions: (i) whether the intervention works as it was intended, (ii) what are the direct impacts of the reform on education and marriage outcomes for women who receive inherited land, and (iii) what are the effects of the reform on resource allocation within landowning households who have not directly experienced an inheritance but may respond to the reform in anticipation of future inheritances. data collection is through a phone survey. the research results will help policy makers craft better land reform policies that reduces the unintended consequences of the reform; the lessons can also be applied to other policies. the results of this research will also help establish the us a global leader in women?s rights."
"Collaborative Research: Understanding the Time Use, Role Behaviors, and Wellbeing of Employees Working From Home","technology first spurred a telecommuting movement in the 1970s. the covid-19 pandemic accelerated the movement into highspeed. the future of work includes a substantial number of workers who will work from home. moreover, organizations continue to grapple with how to meet business demands while also accommodating employees who wish to work remotely. these changes have prompted the need to better understand fully remote and hybrid (i.e., some days in the office and some days from home) work modes and the needs of those who work from home. as such, the project team is analyzing existing daily time use data as well as collecting additional data intended to shine a light on how the location of work alters daily activities (e.g., exercise, sleep), transitions (e.g., switching from work to nonwork roles), and overall employee wellbeing. the findings will be used to provide actionable insights to managers and inform the development of interventions to support remote workers. the project?s objective is to reveal a better understanding of the day-to-day experiences associated with hybrid work and how those experiences differ from work done away from home. the project involves two studies. study 1 is a time use study based on data from the american time use study that enables the research team to examine time use (activity and location) sequence patterns and transitions in 15-minute increments across the course of a 24-hr period. study 2 is a 10-day experience sampling study that includes multiple psychological assessments per day, coupled with objective metrics collected via wearable devices that aims to capture features of the work environment, job, and individual, as well as within-person day-to-day transitions and daily wellbeing. results from the research will contribute to the understanding of challenges and benefits associated with the location of work and have practical implications for organizations and managers."
Collaborative Research: Texas Alliance for Research on Sociological Issues,"hsis are substantially underfunded compared to other institutions of higher education due to relatively low endowment revenue and tuition fees. chronic underfunding leads to infrastructural and technological disparities that disadvantage students as they pursue advanced educational and professional opportunities. this project creates an alliance between four texas hsis to improve institutional competitiveness through: 1) research focused on and directly relevant to creating opportunities across demographic and socio-economic groups; 2) the establishment of physical lab spaces with state-of-the-art computing resources and statistical analysis software; 3) the creation of a virtual lab across all four campuses to facilitate student and faculty mentorship and collaboration; and 4) preparation of students from hsis to enter graduate programs. the project brings students and faculty together from r1, r2, and m1 classified hsis to conduct research relevant to creating opportunities across all demographics and socio-economic groups through two interconnected studies. applying multi-method comparative designs, these studies will advance a deeper understanding of attitudes, experiences, attitudes on immigration, and other thematic areas to address core questions on inequality and opportunity. the creation of physical and virtual lab spaces for these studies will foster equal participation in scientific innovation at each of the collaborating universities by allocating infrastructural resources in proportion to need. these labs will facilitate the development of research and the dissemination of important findings through yearly mini-conferences showcasing student and faculty work, academic publications targeting traditional disciplinary outlets, and white papers designed to make the research accessible to the general public. collectively, the alliance of four universities will address four objectives: (1) the theoretical and methodological development of sociological research, (2) promoting research opportunities for students and faculty at under-resourced hsis, (3) conducting meaningful research on critical sociological issues important to the texas and national social context, and (4) creating a pipeline for students from hsis into scientific training and doctoral graduate programs."
"Collaborative Research: The Conceptualization, Dynamics, and Impacts of Leader and Follower Temporal Management in Contemporary Workplaces","time is a fundamental resource in organizations, shaping how work is performed and influencing the overall efficiency and productivity of the organization. however, effective time management remains a significant challenge, particularly in contemporary workplaces featuring rapidity and flexibility. ineffective time management in organizations is problematic, as it not only hinders project completion and impedes productivity but also leads to poor workload management and increases employee stress and burnout. this project investigates how leaders and followers can collaborate to initiate and coordinate their time management efforts within organizations. the research aims to enhance workplace practices related to time management and develop a workforce skilled in managing time effectively. by doing so, this project seeks to foster a more productive work environment and improve the overall well-being of the workforce. in this project, the research team focuses on the concept of temporal management, defined as the strategic use of time by individuals to affect work patterns, schedules, and productivity within an organization. through three mixed-methods projects, this research aims to contribute significantly to understanding how leaders and followers collaboratively optimize time in organizational settings. the first project (project 1) elucidates the conceptual nature and dimensionality of temporal management in leader-follower dyads. the second project (project 2) advances and tests a formal theory of the dynamic occurrence and influence of leader and follower temporal management. the third project (project 3) investigates the dyad-centric patterns of leader and follower temporal management and their impacts in the context of contemporary workplaces."
Collaborative Research: Conference on Research on New Populations and its Applications,"to advance the science on social factors associated with the well-being ? defined broadly to include social, economic, physical, psychological, and relational dimensions ? of new populations, in this project social scientists are convened to present their research on new populations in the united states and influences on their well-being. with sustained levels of new populations to the country, it is crucial to promote scientific knowledge on their well-being as their population is critical for the sustenance, prosperity, and health of the nation. representing advances in this area across a variety of disciplines ? including anthropology, education, criminal justice, sociology, and economics ? the scholarship presented at this convening will be published in peer-reviewed journals to enhance public knowledge on the barriers and promoters to the well-being of new populations, thereby benefiting us society. specific efforts will be undertaken to recruit scholars from under-represented backgrounds and institutions of varying research capacities, to add a diversity of perspectives to the field. making sound decisions rooted in empirical evidence concerning new populations requires that we create spaces that amplify academic work on the subject, while also creating opportunities for the public to engage with this scholarship in consumable forms. in this conference, a collaborative effort between the george washington university and the university of south florida, participants present high-impact research on the well-being of new populations and take part in applied workshops on best practices for communicating that research to decision makers and the public-at-large. the intellectual merit of the conference includes its interdisciplinary and translational orientation to the application of empirical research. the translational workshops prepare a cohort of scholars with the knowledge and skills to bring empirical insights on publicly engaged scholarship on the well-being of new populations beyond the academy into decision making spaces."
Collaborative Research: HNDS-R: Advancing Diverse Viable Effective Networked Teams (ADVENT),"embracing individual differences can show measurable benefits for teams and organizations. prior research shows that the degree to which team members differ in their identity, experience, and background can positively influence team functioning by increasing information, skills, ability, and knowledge. diverse teams are essential in organizations since they enable individuals to transcend the limits of their specialization, integrate diverse viewpoints, generate innovative ideas, and solve wicked problems. although organizations have promoted heterogeneity in their units for decades, several workers are less likely to engage with teams when forced to work together. and despite the expanded training in organizations, workers? attitudes and behaviors toward individual difference are hard to change. how can organizations simultaneously assemble high-performance and high-viability teams with high heterogeneity and affinity levels? the project identifies ideal team combinations based on team members? existing social connections. in doing so, this research provides innovative solutions to optimize team performance and viability. the ""collaborative research: hnds-r: advancing diverse viable effective networked teams (advent)"" project addresses the challenge of forming high-performance, high-viability teams with significant heterogeneity and affinity levels. this project aims to create an open-source computational network model to optimize team formation by integrating functional individual difference and member affinity. the researchers train and test this computational model using empirical data from four distinct teaming contexts: scientific collaborations, open-source software development, space crews simulating long-duration space exploration missions, and project teams among students in educational and executive development programs. utilizing the multitheoretical multilevel (mtml) framework, the researchers explore how teams within social networks can form at various levels (individual, dyad, triad, and group) and seek to maximize heterogeneity in certain characteristics while enhancing members? affinity in others. key goals include developing an mtml model to elucidate team assembly mechanisms, implementing a data-driven computational model to estimate team performance and viability based on member and network attributes, conducting virtual experiments to explore the impacts of various team configurations, and publishing an interactive web-based exploratorium for users to simulate team performance and viability dynamically."
Collaborative Research: Advancing the study of repression: The Global Surveillance and Censorship Scores (GSCS) dataset,"part 1 under what conditions do states surveil and censor their citizens? how are the two tactics related to each other and other forms of repression and control? to what extent have states concealed their use of these tactics? states have increasingly wielded surveillance and censorship, both digital and physical, as tools of political influence at home and abroad. yet, there exist scant theoretical and empirical advances to help understand these phenomena. consequently, scholars know little of how and when states employ these levers and how their use has evolved with technological advancements. to address this critical knowledge gap, the investigators produce, analyze, and disseminate a novel dataset, the global surveillance and censorship scores (gscs) database. the project utilizes mixed methods to collate quantitative and qualitative historical and contemporary data, including a diverse set of existing human rights reports. the resulting dataset allows academics, practitioners, and policymakers to advance the study of human rights and repression. the project has key implications for american national security and policy, ranging from finance and healthcare to human and drug trafficking, which have been affected by surveillance and censorship practices. part 2 surveillance and censorship are key levers of power to control information. states have increasingly wielded them, digitally and physically, to compete for political influence at home and abroad. yet, scant theoretical and empirical advances exist to help understand the phenomena. consequently, we know little of how and when actors employ these levers, and how their use as repressive techniques evolve with technological advancements in the 21st century. the investigators use mixed-methods to collect quantitative and qualitative historical and contemporary data to develop the global surveillance and censorship scores (gscs) database. information is extracted on surveillance and censorship from a diverse set of existing human rights reports and other documents. given the clandestine nature of surveillance and censorship, a latent variable models developed to address missing information and to assess the sensitivity of the model estimates to understand the extent to which states conceal the use of such tools. this bayesian latent variable model is able to predict cases of missing information and aggregate information into country-year estimates. to further address bias in the reports, the investigators also conduct case studies using expert information, interviews, and archival research to validate the data. the project will allow researchers to generate new theories and empirical evidence to advance the study of human rights, censorship, and surveillance. the data and analytic deliverables will serve as a public good for the community of academics, practitioners, and policymakers. surveillance and censorship increasingly shape geopolitics by controlling and manipulating information; understanding the evolution of censorship and surveillance can thus contribute to the development of sound foreign and security policies."
Collaborative Research: Examining the effects of gender composition on disruptive science,"scientific teams are increasingly disrupting science by making pivotal discoveries and breakthroughs. these disruptive teams reshape established scientific paradigms and forge new ones, eclipsing established theories, methods, and research directions. consequently, understanding the factors that foster disruptive scientific teams is essential for promoting new scientific paradigms, theories, methods, and avenues for future research. previous research has documented the effects of team size, hierarchies, and distance among members on scientific disruption. however, the influence of gender composition on teams? abilities to make disruptive discoveries and create new inventions remains underexplored. drawing on previous research in gender composition and scientific disruption, the researchers aim to investigate the effects of gender composition on disruption and examine the causal mechanisms that could explain differences in its impact. this project encompasses three research goals. first, the project analyzes the impact of gender composition on disruption by examining more than 49 million papers and 4 million patents across different scientific fields over the last 50 years. the results yield empirical evidence of the impact of different gender compositions on scientific disruption. second, the project conducts a laboratory experiment with 320 participants to understand the causal mechanisms that drive these effects. this experiment, which controls for gender composition, requires three-person teams to complete a disruption task that is designed for this experience and based on disruption research. third, the project involves a massive survey and follow-up interviews with female scientists who have been part of disruptive teams to learn about their experiences and insights. this research promises to enhance understanding of the effects of different gender compositions on teams? disruptiveness and contributions to science. the project highlights the theoretical and practical implications of specific team combinations in scientific research, giving institutions and funders information they can use as they reflect on the role of gender composition in scientific teams."
Collaborative Research: Ownership and Technology Adoption: Evidence from the Census of Manufactures,"productivity growth is a fundamental driver of increased living standards, and this project explores sources of manufacturing productivity growth as the united states rose to global economic prominence. the researchers seeks to understand firms? technology adoption decisions during a past period of rapid technical change. there is a great deal of current policy discussion surrounding technology adoption, both in the united states and worldwide. the rapid pace of technological change naturally raises questions about how firms are able to adapt to changing environments. the historical experiences associated with the development of the american economy inform our understanding of the underlying sources of sustained long-run economic growth, which provides an historical benchmark for comparison and contrast with the modern era. the researchers? preliminary estimates highlight the importance of ownership for firm behavior and outcomes. in milling, changes in ownership are associated with a substantial increase in the likelihood of firms upgrading from water power to steam power. across all of manufacturing, female owners are more likely to own smaller establishments, but employ more women (and pay them more). the importance of ownership highlights how unequal access to funds and new technologies can be a driver of inequality. the researchers also explore how access to markets affected firm dynamics, as an expanding railroad network increased market integration. the main objective of this project is to compile a new open-access panel database of us manufacturing establishments from existing census administrative records. the researchers have trained a team to digitize images of the handwritten census manuscript pages and make panel links from one decade to the next. through this project, the research team will complete these panel links, across all industries, and make the database easily accessible and freely available. the us census of manufactures is an establishment-level government census of all manufacturing establishments above a minimal size. the census of manufactures was professionalized and comprehensive beginning in 1850, and census enumeration was done in-person by us marshals. by making available new data on every manufacturing establishment, linked over time, this project enables further research into the historical development of the american economy. this database allows researchers and policymakers to understand better the underlying drivers of economic growth and improvements in living standards."
Collaborative Research: Extending and Further Developing the Militarized Interstate Confrontation Dataset,"the correlates of war militarized interstate dispute (cowmid) dataset provides the infrastructure for most studies of the onset and escalation of conflict in the united states and globally. however, the dataset is error-prone and inconsistent across time and region. this project alters this condition by further developing and extending the data of all militarized interstate events by two or more countries, across the globe. the project collects these data using supervised machine-learning models. first, a common set of search terms for international conflicts are used to identify newspaper articles that contain militarized events between two or more countries. using state-of-the-art advancements in artificial intelligence (ai) for textual analysis and classification, the project employs already-collected newspaper source information to train a model to identify confirmed militarized events. the source information spans 1993 to 2014. this infrastructure reduces the monetary and time-associated costs of subsequent data collection, providing near real-time data availability for both policymakers and conflict researchers who investigating the causes and consequences of international conflict. the project uses a now-common process for identifying and coding large amounts of text. the first part of the project collects and cleans the text corpora (newspaper article coverage of mics). all newspaper articles will then be tokenized into paragraphs, converting the text into units of analysis. in the text input phase, each paragraph is attributed a feature if it contains information relevant to a variable with the classification described in the mie codebook. finally, these labelled datasets can be used to fine-tune the bert classifier, building models for each variable to code new events automatically. since these variable-level classifications are built for the first time, graduate students and faculty jointly hand-code the newspaper articles as well. traditional coding helps train the model-building process, and the parallel process serves as a check for accuracy, performance, and quality on both approaches to coding. at the end of the project, variable coding will be completed by the variable models."

"Collaborative Research: Diagnostic Expectations, Uncertainty, and Macroeconomic Fluctuations","this award funds research in macroeconomics and bounded rationality. the team starts with the observation that in the formalization of representativeness (kahneman and tversky, 1972) developed by gennaioli and shleifer (2010), overreaction and confidence are affected by uncertainty, as a news effect interacts with an uncertainty effect. in the time series domain, this interaction emerges in a smooth version of diagnostic expectations (de). under smooth diagnostic expectations (smooth de), agents overreact to new information. since new information typically changes not just the conditional mean, but also the conditional uncertainty, changes in uncertainty surrounding current and past beliefs affect the severity of the de distortion and confidence. as a result, smooth de ends up connecting two vastly popular branches of economics that have largely proceeded in parallel: the diagnostic expectations literature and the uncertainty literature (bloom, 2014). the research consists of three projects. in the first project, the team highlights the inherent link between representativeness and uncertainty and introduces smooth de as the natural time series formalization of such a link. under smooth de, agents over-react to new information as captured by the change in the current distribution of future events with respect to a reference distribution. changes in uncertainty surrounding current and past beliefs affect the extent of the de distortion. smooth de implies a joint and parsimonious micro-foundation for key properties of survey data: (1) overreaction of conditional mean to news, (2) stronger overreaction for weaker signals and longer forecast horizons, and (3) overconfidence in subjective uncertainty. in the second project, the team studies quantitative business cycle models that leverage insights from the smooth de framework, as well as from the team?s previous work on de, imperfect information, and non-linear solution methods. the goal is to provide a rigorous and parsimonious account of business cycle properties that emerges from a smooth de model with signal extraction. an analytical rbc model featuring smooth de accounts for overreaction and overconfidence in surveys, as well as three salient properties of the business cycle: (1) asymmetry, (2) countercyclical micro volatility, and (3) countercyclical macro volatility. a negative shock that raises perceived uncertainty increases the over-reaction to both idiosyncratic and aggregate shocks, and deepens the contraction. this rich and novel propagation arises because the intensity of the de distortion is state-dependent. in the third project, the team focuses on actionable implications. under smooth de, the severity of the de distortion varies in response to the level of uncertainty faced by agents. the team uncovers a novel role for decision makers: by reducing uncertainty, decision makers can now reduce the severity of the de distortion and thus stabilize agents? psychological biases. thus, a redistributive rules that reduce cross-sectional uncertainty could also be beneficial for macroeconomic stabilization. the team studies the novel welfare implications of this belief stabilization"
Collaborative Research: Empirical Analysis of the Practice of Price Discrimination in the Airline Industry,"the practice of charging different prices to different consumers, i.e., price discrimination, is commonly used by firms in a variety of industries with the intention of increasing profits. yet, little is known about the impact on consumers of modern sophisticated discriminatory pricing practices that leverage increasingly detailed information. this gap in understanding must be overcome to develop rules that balance positive aspects of these practices like efficiency against redistributive harm and privacy concerns. the researchers study these issues in the context of two different strategies used in the airline industry: personalized pricing via targeted discounts and auctions for upgraded services and amenities. the empirical analysis relies on unique data obtained from a north american airline to gain deeper insights into the practice of price discrimination by evaluating current and potential price-discrimination strategies. the results of the analysis provide insight into the effectiveness of different strategies and methods on profit and consumer welfare, while also offering guidance to decision makers on how to limit any negative impacts on consumers. the research contributes to knowledge of the welfare impacts of modern discriminatory pricing practices, as well as the challenges associated with implementation. the detailed proprietary data used in the empirical analysis provides a unique opportunity to study two different practices used in the airline industry: personalized pricing via targeted discounts and upgrade auctions. the results of the analysis regarding firms? ability to leverage increasingly detailed data and implement sophisticated mechanisms to price discriminate is directly of interest to economists and important for development of rules to limit harm to consumers. the contribution of the research is in the field of econometrics and industrial organization, and specifically advances econometric methods for personalized pricing and integration of auctions into a dynamic-pricing environment. these advancements provide a framework for studying these topics in other industries, and guidance for important discussions around data privacy and price discrimination."
"SBP: Collaborative Research: Understanding the Time Use, Role Behaviors, and Wellbeing of Employees Working From Home","technology first spurred a telecommuting movement in the 1970s. the covid-19 pandemic accelerated the movement into highspeed. the future of work includes a substantial number of workers who will work from home. moreover, organizations continue to grapple with how to meet business demands while also accommodating employees who wish to work remotely. these changes have prompted the need to better understand fully remote and hybrid (i.e., some days in the office and some days from home) work modes and the needs of those who work from home. as such, the project team is analyzing existing daily time use data as well as collecting additional data intended to shine a light on how the location of work alters daily activities (e.g., exercise, sleep), transitions (e.g., switching from work to nonwork roles), and overall employee wellbeing. the findings will be used to provide actionable insights to managers and inform the development of interventions to support remote workers. the project?s objective is to reveal a better understanding of the day-to-day experiences associated with hybrid work and how those experiences differ from work done away from home. the project involves two studies. study 1 is a time use study based on data from the american time use study that enables the research team to examine time use (activity and location) sequence patterns and transitions in 15-minute increments across the course of a 24-hr period. study 2 is a 10-day experience sampling study that includes multiple psychological assessments per day, coupled with objective metrics collected via wearable devices that aims to capture features of the work environment, job, and individual, as well as within-person day-to-day transitions and daily wellbeing. results from the research will contribute to the understanding of challenges and benefits associated with the location of work and have practical implications for organizations and managers."
Collaborative Research: A Multi-faceted Analysis of Small Business Lending Dynamics,"small businesses form the backbone of the u.s. economy, yet significant disparities exist in access to capital and entrepreneurial opportunities for various demographic groups. this project seeks to advance national prosperity and welfare by dismantling systemic obstacles that prevent equitable participation in entrepreneurial activities. by developing novel research tools to examine underlying market frictions and facilitate inclusive funding opportunities, the project holds promise for empowering underserved communities, unlocking untapped economic potential, and creating a more level playing field for all aspiring entrepreneurs nationwide. the project establishes two interconnected research infrastructures with a cross-country scope: (1) the small business lender preference and perception (sblpp) database, consolidating survey data on nearly 9,300 u.s. community banks and credit unions regarding their lending preferences, market perceptions, and institutional strengths and (2) fundmatch, an online platform using sblpp data to match entrepreneurs with lenders aligned to their financing needs and preferences, reducing search frictions. fundmatch enables field experiments identifying and addressing demand-side barriers like borrower discouragement. this researcher-entrepreneur-lender nexus yields actionable insights to foster inclusive entrepreneurial ecosystems and drive equitable economic development across regions."
Collaborative Research: Measuring selection in insurance markets due to genetic prediction,"this award will fund research that studies the impacts of the development of improved predictive power of genetic testing on insurance markets. while scientific advances have led to increased predictive power of genetic data, many jurisdictions prohibit insurers from using genetic information to risks in underwriting, a situation that leads to consumers who know they are genetically predisposed to develop certain diseases decide to buy more insurance forcing insurers to raise prices for all. this research project combines large-scale genetic data, economic theory, and econometrics to study the impact of future genetic prediction technology on adverse selection in the market for critical illness insurance, and the more complex health, life, and long-term care insurance markets. in addition, the project will provide estimates of the future predictive power of genetic information for a large set of diseases, beyond what can be predicted by non-genetic risk factors. results of this research will help decision makers to design better practices to ensure better functioning of insurance markets. the results will also provide input into practices to protect the most vulnerable in health insurance markets. this award funds a research project to study the effects of improved genetic testing on the functioning of health insurance market. the pis first develop a method to measure the amount of adverse selection that would take place in a given insurance market if consumers had access to their current genetic information. the pis the combine this estimates with estimates from heritability studies to estimate the amount adverse selection that would occur with future genetic prediction technology. these studies are based on a large-scale data on genetics, non-genetic risk factors, and insured events. third, the researchers apply this method to existing insurance markets to measure adverse selection with both current and future genetic predictions. finally the project augments the methodology with survival analysis specification and applies it to a large set of diseases and to project future predictive power of genetic information above that of observed covariates. the results of this research will provide inputs into the design of better practices to ensure efficient functioning of insurance markets. the results will also provide input into practices to protect the most vulnerable in health insurance markets."
Collaborative Research: Exascale supercomputing: Tracing the socio-technical alliances that enable big science,"in summer 2024, the argonne national laboratory (anl) will launch aurora, which will be the world?s most powerful public supercomputer. despite the centrality of supercomputer development to maintaining u.s. global leadership position in the advancement of science and technology and substantial taxpayer investment, the public rarely has the opportunity to stand in the thrumming, chilly machine room among the rows and rows of towers of compute nodes that comprise a supercomputer. as a result, questions such as, ?how do you build a supercomputer?? ?what does a supercomputer do??, ?what do scientists and other staff do all day at the supercomputing center??, ?what does the supercomputer do that affects me??, and ?why does the us need the fastest supercomputers?? don?t have concrete answers. this project is designed to answer those questions and deepen public understanding of massive supercomputing infrastructures for generating new forms of knowledge. the researchers have been invited by the anl division director to do on-site and remote observational and interview research with individuals and processes related to aurora, including argonne employees working on aurora, scientists running projects on aurora, and the technical documentation that makes aurora possible. the project will proceed in two related phases: the first phase will focus on the everyday practices of supercomputing and how a big science project is used and maintained through the work of scientists, operations staff, and technical documentation processes; the second phase will move from analysis of the everyday practices of supercomputing to higher-level examinations of how the global competition for supercomputing leadership has been shaped by, and also shapes, the u.s.?s identity as a leader in scientific and technological advancement. the project is designed to increase public awareness of the many hidden elements of supercomputing while also developing opportunities for undergraduate and graduate students at portland state university and clemson university to work with the u.s. national laboratory system and learn about the world of public supercomputing."
Collaborative Research: Food Industry in Rural Communities: Understanding Place and Labor-Related Dynamics and Corporate Strategies,"this research studies how decisions in industry influence the movement of people, animals, and resources into rural america. the specific research questions pursued are: (1) how are multinational companies in the food sector shaping land use in rural areas of the us? (2) what are the stated and tacit reasons why such multinational companies open facilities in sparsely populated rural areas? (3) how are federal-and state-specific decisions related to this industry?s labor needs? (4) what measures have public officeholders taken to shape location and labor supply decisions for these facilities? and (5) how do the strategies used at different rural industry sites help us understand the human, non-human, and ecological advantages and disadvantages of the contemporary protein industry and supply chain? methodologically, the project focuses on roughly 54 facilities, nested within 20 counties between two us states. these two distinctive regions allow for a comparison between states where relevant rules differ. data collection includes two years of participant observation at industry meetings; ethnographic interviews with industry representatives; ethnographic interviews with community groups, public officials, and community members; analysis of descriptive statistics; and critical analysis of public documents. though qualitative in focus, the research is triangulated with quantitative secondary data from governmental and publicly available sources. conducting research in these two regions allows for the comparison of industry strategies in a manner that accounts for both hyperlocal impacts and transnational industry trends, while offering practical and translatable findings for local constituencies."
Collaborative Research: How International Reputation Accrues across Multiple Policy Domains,"when two states face off in an international crisis, why does one state believe that its rival will capitulate, rather than escalate to war? recent research suggests specific past actions ? such as fighting in past crises or honoring alliance commitments ? influence a state?s reputation as resolved to fight. yet past studies have explored just one determinant of reputation in isolation from the others. this project will develop a comprehensive theoretical framework to explain which actions, or combinations of actions, matter most for building a reputation. it will also collect new data on cross-national historical events and cross-national survey data to establish which past foreign and domestic policy choices by states influence their likelihood of facing military challenges and the outcomes of international crises. this project advances u.s. national security in two ways. first, it will help to identify periods of heighted risk to u.s. interests by showing which specific domestic and foreign policy choices can create the impression of weak u.s. resolve. second, it will explain how reputational damage from avoiding international conflict in one instance can be offset by other choices, such as alliance commitments or even domestic political actions. this means that the u.s. does not need to engage in every possible conflict in order to sustain a reputation as resolved to fight in future disputes. this project is the first to investigate how international reputations accumulate through many different past actions. instead of simply studying whether past actions matter, it will provide a framework for assessing how much different actions matter relative to each other, and how they work in combination. the framework will bridge the gap between rationalist and psychological studies of reputation by using formal theory to predict how much actions that reveal certain psychological attributes will contribute to perceptions of resolve. the investigators will test expectations in a rigorous, multi-method manner. they will use u.s. and international survey experiments to provide causal estimates of the relative reputational impact of various actions. they will use quantitative coding of declassified intelligence documents, qualitative case studies, and interviews with u.s. officials to illuminate how elites utilize their rival?s diverse actions to estimate their rival?s resolve. finally, they will collect novel cross-national data to understand which past actions influence reputations across history."
Collaborative Research: Moderator Interventions and the Automated Coding of Status Hierarchies in Task Groups,"the formation of hierarchies in task groups is a ubiquitous process, but these hierarchies are not always stable. group hierarchies can evolve with the contributions of members. if a comparatively low status group member makes a positive contribution to the group, for example, they are likely to increase their standing in the overall group. conversely, if a relatively high status group member makes a poor contribution, they are likely to decrease their standing. this research systematically varies moderator interventions to study their effects on the contributions of various group members to evaluate whether group moderators can enhance or flatten the emergence of hierarchies in task groups and what the effects of this are for task success. drawing on existing research on status dynamics, moderators intervene in task discussions to enhance the standing of comparatively low status group members. to study these processes, the research uses experimental and computational methods. first, moderator interventions are experimentally varied. in a control condition, moderators do not intervene in the emergence of the group?s status hierarchy. in two experimental conditions, moderators use cues and interventions from the extant literature on status dynamics to enhance the perceived standing of comparatively low status group members. influence over the group is measured and used to evaluate whether moderator interventions are successful in mitigating task irrelevant characteristics from shaping the power and prestige order of the group. also examined is what this means for task success. the research further develops a computational pipeline that uses natural language processing to track the group?s status hierarchy. the group?s conversation for status-relevant information is coded and machine learning algorithms ?learn? the codes that humans assign to the text. this enables automatically coding of subsequent conversations for status-relevant information. collectively, the work evaluates new moderator interventions to make task groups more egalitarian, and develops computational tools to automate the coding of hierarchy formation in task groups."
Collaborative Research: Adaptation of Populations to Heightened Flood Incidence: Satellite Data and Experimental Evaluations of Early Warning Systems,"this award will fund a research project that investigates how farmers in low-income settings adapt to increased risk of flooding, the effects of these flood episodes on health, and how these farmers access and use information on accurate flood forecast. climate change is increasing flood risks globally, impacting one in four individuals, but not much is known about how agriculture adapts to increased flood risk and this research makes significant contribution to our understanding of how farmers adapt to flood risks. the proposed research consists of two projects. the first project will combine the global flood database, nasa?s modis satellite imagery and enhanced vegetation index to study the impact of flooding on agriculture with a focus on how farmers change their farming practices, crop choices, and the health of affected people. the second project will study how farmers access and use accurate flood forecasts by combining a community-based outreach program with google?s flood forecasting system. the results of this research will provide important inputs into policies to increase resilience in flood-prone regions and provide guidance on u.s. foreign aid policies. this award will fund research that uses two projects to investigate the effects of flooding on agricultural practices and livelihoods of people in low-income settings. the first project will combine data from the global flood database, nasa?s modis satellite imagery, and the enhanced vegetation index to assess the impacts of flooding on agriculture, focusing on land use dynamics by farmers. the pis will study the contemporaneous and long-term impact of flooding on agricultural production, crop choice, and whether flooding?s effect on agriculture varies by its timing. the second project expands on an existing project that enhances the reach and impact of flood early warning systems (ews) in low-income settings. to do this, the pis will combine google?s advanced flood-forecasting technology with a community-based alert system. the community-based outreach will be randomized for treatment and control communities."
Collaborative Research: Retooling at the Hydro-Frontier: Devices for Resource Extraction in the 21st Century,"experts predict that water scarcity may cause future conflict. in response, scientists and technologists have developed new methods for maximizing the use of water as a resource, as well as for extracting resources found in water. this project examines such efforts, particularly technologies to make wastewater usable through membrane-based filtration technologies and retrofittable fermenters. it asks to what extent these new water extraction technologies reproduce existing social and environmental issues around water usage, or alternatively provide the basis for more equitable resource distribution systems in the twenty-first century. the project will support training graduate and undergraduate students in an interdisciplinary approach to conducting scientific data collection and analysis. it includes interactive exhibits for presentation at industry conferences and county fairs that help expert and everyday expert groups understand how they anticipate that technologies for retooling water resource extraction might contribute to addressing water and resource insecurity. the project will develop conceptual tools for understanding resource extraction in a future characterized by scarcity and conflict. it investigates how devices used for water resource extraction are being retooled in the early 21st century in response to anticipated challenges shaped by water quantity, water quality, and climate-related water risks. to do this, the research team will use historical, ethnographic, and arts-informed empirical research methods to examine how scientists, decision makers, and other stakeholders anticipate using already-existing membrane and wastewater fermentation technologies (devices) to extend and retool historical conceptions of where water exists, what constitutes a usable form of water/resource, and how water can be used. by studying these devices at new frontiers of water extraction, this project aims to develop the concept of retooling to help scholars describe the zone in between scholarship on maintenance and innovation; and to generate insights into broader shifts in resource extraction and innovation decisions."
Collaborative Research: The scientific cost of isolationism: An analysis of disruptions in the global science system,"this study examines the impact of non-science isolation practices on scientific production and collaboration. the research deepens our understanding of how national scientific systems are interconnected with global economic and political dynamics, providing insights on the impact of scientific cooperation across countries and sectors. the study addresses fundamental issues at the intersection of science strategy, international relations, and research productivity including how restrictive measures and geopolitical shifts affect international scientific collaboration, researcher mobility, and resource exchange. the project serves the national interest by promoting the progress of science through a better understanding of the factors that influence global scientific cooperation. the results provide decision makers with empirical evidence to inform strategic decision-making in the governance of scientific activities. this knowledge is crucial for maintaining the united states as a leader in global scientific research and innovation. the findings from this study have broader impacts on national health, prosperity, and welfare by helping to navigate international scientific collaboration in an increasingly complex geopolitical landscape. the researchers employ quasi-experimental designs utilizing three recent global events. these events serve as cases to examine the causal impact of disengagement from the integrated global scientific community on scientific development. the study will use causal inference techniques, specifically the synthetic control method and difference-in-differences analysis. these methods are applied to investigate changes in scientific publication production and the exchange of scientific capital, including funding resources and researcher mobility. to address potential biases in international databases, the project constructs a comprehensive dataset incorporating publication records from both international and national sources. by using causal inference frameworks, the researchers offer nuanced insights into the consequences of withdrawing from the integrated scientific community while mitigating the influence of other factors."
Collaborative Research: Impulse Response Analysis for Nonlinear Structural VARs,"understanding the dynamic response of economic outcomes to a variety of changes is crucial for studying fluctuations in economic activity and designing fiscal or monetary actions aimed at reducing these fluctuations. this award funds a research project that will develop econometric methods to estimate the impulse response function that are central to the study of how the economy responds to various changes in nonlinear environments. the research project will also illustrate the performance of the estimators in large and small samples. the results of this research will provide empirical researchers with a general framework for the estimation of dynamic responses in many environments. the research will also develop a statistical software to implement the new estimation method. in addition to its contribution to econometric methods, the results of this research will improve macroeconomic decision making, which will reduce economic fluctuations, increase economic growth, and improve the living standards of citizens. this award funds a research project that will contribute to the literature on impulse response functions in a large class of nonlinear structural vars (svars). this study will discuss different notions of impulse response functions, study the validity and performance of local projections, and propose new estimation methods for the average impulse response function and the conditional average response function. the project will develop nonparametric estimation methods that allow researchers to be agnostic about the functional form in models with nonlinear regressors, the process driving the switch between states in state-dependent models and the form of interactions between shocks and initial economic conditions in models with interactions. it will also develop estimation methods for time-varying svar models and state-dependent favar models. the project will also develop an econometric software to implement the new method. besides improving estimation of structural var models, the results of this research will improve macroeconomic decision making, which will reduce economic fluctuations, increase economic growth, and improve the living standards of citizens."
Collaborative Research: Incentivizing and Spotlighting Scientific Contributions in Legislative Studies,"to maximize scientific contributions in the field of legislative studies, this project creates a new initiative with the mission to engage, support, and promote the study of legislative politics across gender and sub-disciplinary divides. the initiative hosts virtual events monthly throughout the year, a professional development seminar, a research seminar, and a writing group, an in-person annual conference. the project also maintains a website and listserve with over 550 members and promotes women?s research via social media. additionally, the initiative collects/analyzes data on women in legislative studies. this project seeks to bring new research and perspectives to scholarship on legislative politics by promoting the study of legislative politics across gender and sub-disciplinary divides. the initiative focuses on the research being done by a diverse set of scholars studying legislatures around the world. one of the aims of the project is to bridge the gap across the study of individual legislatures and the study of legislatures in comparative perspective. bringing together a diverse set of scholars of legislative politics will encourage intellectual contributions that bridge these subfields. the initiative hosts virtual events monthly throughout the year, a professional development seminar, a research seminar, and a writing group, an in-person annual conference. the project also maintains a website and listserve with over 550 members and promotes women?s research via social media. additionally, the initiative collects/analyzes data on women in legislative studies."
Collaborative Research: RAPID: The Role and Effectiveness of Instructional Risk and Crisis Biosecurity Recommendation Messages during the H5N1 Dairy Crisis,"viral infections by the highly pathogenic avian influenza virus (hpai) a/h5n1 have historically affected wild birds with costly outbreaks periodically spreading in poultry flocks. with the emergence of hpai clade 2.3.4.4b, new avian species and, even more concerning, terrestrial mammal infections have been reported, including an outbreak in dairy cattle, thereby creating an unprecedented and urgent health risk. the food and drug administration reported that samples of pasteurized milk taken from grocery stores in the united states have tested positive for h5n1. dairy farmers are key stakeholders, as their biosecurity strategies can minimize risks to the food supply. to do so, however, they need clear and actionable instructional messages. as the situation evolves dynamically and a potential crisis unfolds, the research team assesses and tests the efficacy of biosecurity recommendation messages. specifically, the researchers (1) monitor real-time h5n1 crisis message recommendations in both social and traditional media to identify crisis constraints and misinformation; (2) assess the perceptions of dairy farmers and other national and state stakeholders who are responsible for identifying effective biosecurity strategies for managing the risk; and (3) provide feedback and recommendations to practitioners based on principles of instructional risk communication as articulated in the idea model. the idea model?s primary assumption is that instructional risk and crisis messages are most effective when they include a balance of internalization (affective learning), explanation (cognitive learning), recommendations for action (behavioral learning), along with considerations of how the messages can best be distributed. the intention of the research is to produce findings generalizable to biosecurity threats beyond this particular avian influenza virus."
"Collaborative Research: From Displacement to Resilience: Aid, Economic Recovery, and Social Cohesion in Post-Conflict Societies","this award will fund a research project to investigate whether post-conflict economic recovery programs to reestablish livelihoods and rebuild local economies alleviate one of the root causes of conflict---low social cohesion---by increasing economic interdependence, increasing intergroup contact, and generate economic activity that increases the opportunity costs of crime. this project will study these dynamics in an economic recovery program spearheaded by the united nations in an environment where years of conflict has led to significant social tensions. the focus of the study is on how these programs indirectly affect social cohesion through individuals? social networks. the researchers therefore will engage in painstaking data collection of social network data for the analyses of these indirect channels. the research will inform the broader understanding of how aid to rebuild livelihoods impacts sociopolitical development and the prevention of conflict relapse after civil war. the indirect mechanism studied will provide input to guide the development and implement more efficient policies. this award will fund a research project that seeks to understand whether and how post-conflict economic recovery programs affect economic opportunities and social cohesion in the communities. the project will use a randomized controlled trial (rct) methodology to investigate three interrelated research questions: (i) how do economic livelihood programs improve or erode social cohesion between hosts, returnees, and internally displaced persons (idps)? (ii) how do these programs have broader effects on displacement-affected communities through social and economic networks? (iii) when traditional approaches to estimating spillover effects are not available due to program features, costs, or ethics, what do feasible alternatives recover? the pis will answer these questions by conducting a series of innovative and well-designed rcts in a large post conflict area. the answers to these questions have the potential to inform both research and program design, especially of us foreign aid policy, in numerous contexts where similar social dynamics or interventions exist."
Collaborative Research: Framework for Better Visual Communication Practices,"every day, people use scientific information to make decisions that affect their lives. consequently, it is critical that the results of scientific research on topics impacting the public are communicated effectively. data visualization is an important part of scientific communication, yet much guidance on the clear and effective design of data graphics has not been tested among a representative population of u.s. adults. the researchers examine how accurately users interpret the information conveyed in different types of data visualizations. the findings support evidence-based recommendations that aid in the fair and equitable communication of scientific information across demographic groups and subpopulations. this research advances understanding of data visualization as a method of communication and provide comprehensive data on viewer interpretation and understanding of data graphics among the adult u.s. population. the researchers implement an online survey through a web portal to 2,000 respondents from a probability-based, nationally representative panel of u.s. adults. respondents are shown multiple types of data visualizations with various design elements, such as bar and line charts with varying levels of supporting context and asked questions that measure their understanding and interpretation of the data presented. survey questions then ask about basic interpretation of the values presented in a chart and open-ended responses about what conclusions respondents can draw about the data shown. the researchers analyze the data using generalized linear models, natural language processing, and text analysis techniques to determine the effect of different elements of data visualization design, such as the type of chart or supporting context, on user understanding, and the extent to which understanding may vary across demographic groups. the project is co-funded by the science of science: discovery, communications, and impact and the advancing informal stem learning programs."
Collaborative Research: Effective Design of Institutions and Data Sharing Platforms in International Environmental Agreements,"this project assesses information sharing rules and practices in four international environmental agreements (ieas) that govern global biodiversity conservation and sustainable use. information sharing is critical to building trust and cooperative action among diverse actors and iea member states in order to reach jointly agreed-upon global conservation objectives. in practice, however, iea member countries follow a range of strategies for the selective sharing of information in order to promote different economic, social, or political objectives. at the same time, national funding agencies, non-governmental conservation organizations, and businesses are investing heavily in emerging technologies for monitoring and sharing data about global biodiversity conditions. nonetheless, little is known about the current design and effectiveness of iea information sharing platforms, or how iea parties interact with global scientific data infrastructures in the context of meeting treaty obligations. in response, the project will advance knowledge of the complex landscape of global information sharing in conservation by examining the formal iea information sharing rules and how they are mediated and operationalized through digital infrastructures by a variety of actors, including iea secretariats, government representatives, researchers, and conservation organizations. it will also map the data and decision-making linkages and gaps within and across the iea information sharing platforms. project findings will provide a systematic and holistic understanding of information sharing?s role in environmental governance and inform improvement and innovation in biodiversity resource management. the project uses a mixed-method approach to analyze the degree to which conservation-related data are exchanged on iea platforms, how the level of exchange differs within and across iea regimes, and how information sharing has been codified formally and in practice. this is accomplished by (i) using a standardized syntax called the institutional grammar to parse formal rules governing information sharing practices into core components and identify their rule type configurations by function (e.g., monitoring); (ii) examining the iea platforms? technical architectures and contents through a combination of it staff interviews, data analytics, and database structure review; and (iii) interviewing key international and national decisionmakers to gain insights on information sharing perceptions and practices. the qualitative and quantitative data gained in steps (i) to (iii) will inform a structural equation model designed to identify factors salient to the variation in actors? information sharing propensities. iea platforms offer a major opportunity to investigate long-standing assumptions about the importance of information sharing to effective resource governance. this project taps into that potential to investigate how the social and technical designs of iea data infrastructures influence trust and transparency. project results will include descriptive analyses of similarities and differences in the configuration of formal iea information sharing rules, insights into iea platform design, interconnectivity, and management of shared information, and the propensity of actors to engage with the rules and platform infrastructure and effectively share information. these results are also significant for recognizing and addressing equity and justice issues, e.g. for marginalized peoples and lower income nations."
Collaborative Research: Build and Broaden 2.0: California Alliance for Hispanic-serving Social Science Advancement (CAHSSA),"this award is funded in whole or in part under the american rescue plan act of 2021 (public law 117-2). the california alliance for hispanic-serving social science advancement (cahssa) builds and broadens the low participation of social science faculty in extramurally funded research with an examination of systemic barriers and comprehensive professional development programming and policies. the partnership between three california universities will serve 28 hispanic-serving institutions (hsis) of various sizes and representing unique regional factors in the california state university (csu) and the university of california (uc) systems. the outcomes of this project will serve as a model to advance research in wide-ranging disciplines that impact the health, prosperity, and welfare of the us public. cahssa implements a comparative content analysis of nsf social science proposal review comments at hsis and non-hsis to identify how social, behavioral, and economic research is constructed and practiced across institutional types as well as reveal any existing biases in the review process. results will inform the project's interventions that include virtual grant writing webinars and workshops, writing groups, intensive writing retreats, and social science leader seminars for more than 700 csu and uc social sciences faculty and leaders. the california alliance for hispanic-serving social science advancement (cahssa) will pursue a greater understanding of the challenges faced by social scientists at hispanic-serving institutions (hsis) and minority-serving institutions (msis) in the extramural funding process at the micro-level within varied campus types and at the macro-level through the examination of nsf reviewer perceptions of social science proposals. from a pool of nearly 4500, the pis recruit more than 700 social sciences researchers and leaders from 22 california state university (csu) hsi campuses and six university of california (uc) hsi campuses to participate in virtual webinars and workshops (n=500 researchers), writing groups (n=160 researchers), writing retreats (n=60 researchers), and seminars (n=100 leaders). methods include csu and uc annual systemwide surveys, pre- and post-intervention participant evaluation surveys, focus group interviews, and content analysis of grant reviewer comments on 500 proposals over the prior ten years. the results of this project will serve as a national model for advancing a new dialogue on faculty professional development and the science of broadening participation by studying institutional factors that shape social science grant success at hsis/msis. the interventions will produce innovative grant proposals to enhance research in the social sciences as well as the revision of policies and procedures to strengthen practices that support social sciences grant and research activity at hsis/msis."
Collaborative Research: Flexible Regression Methods for Climate Economics,"effective climate policy design requires reliable methods to measure the economic impacts of climate change. an interest in climate and environmental economics is the effect of additional exposure to different temperature levels on economic outcomes. because damage from increased exposure tends to be most severe at extreme temperatures, correctly capturing these effects is important to inform climate and environmental policy. existing methods use year-to-year changes in temperature and other climatic variables to measure the impact of these climatic variables on various outcomes, thus are not able to account for these extreme temperatures. this award funds research that will develop flexible regression methods that account for the extremes in exposure and thus offer new methods to accurately measure the effects of climate change on economic outcomes. the research will also study other flexible regression methods that build on the new flexible methods developed in this study. the researchers will develop statistical software that will be used to implement the new methods thus making them widely useful to applied researchers. the new methods will improve climate research quality as well as enhance research in other social sciences. the research results will also improve climate and environmental policy making and implementation as well as help to establish the us as a global leader in climate economics. binned regression models used to estimate and draw causal inference in mixed frequency panel data in climate economics have many drawbacks that have not been addressed despite their ubiquitous use in climate economics research. this award will fund research to develop a comprehensive toolkit for understanding the flexible binned regressions methods with mixed-frequency panel data method, and generalizations thereof. the unique technical and methodological challenges posed in this approach will be addressed as part of this grant. in particular, the research will demonstrate the empirical and theoretical limitations with current approaches that can potentially lead to incorrect conclusions. it will also develop more robust, data-driven estimation and inference methods. the theoretical work will also contribute to the literature on non-parametric estimation and inference for mixed-frequency panel data. the contributions of the research under this award are expected to include several novel mathematical statistics results. finally, the research will develop general purpose statistical software, train graduate students, and produce general interest review articles. the new methods will improve climate research quality and policy as well as enhance research in other social sciences. the research results will also help to establish the us as a global leader in climate economics."
Collaborative Research: The Supply-Side of the United States Supreme Court Docket,"as the ultimate arbiter of crucial legal disputes, the u.s. supreme court occupies a pivotal position in american democracy. however, relatively few cases make it to the court. in any given year, the court receives thousands of petitions asking it to review lower court decisions, of which less than one hundred are granted review, or writ of certiorari. the discretionary authority to choose its cases endows the court with substantial influence in shaping national public policy. given the statistical rarity of a case receiving a formal decision by the u.s. supreme court, and the unrepresentative nature of the petitions that justices choose among, it is critical to understand not just the decisions the court makes on the merit, but also the density and diversity of issues and interests competing for the court?s consideration. how does the supply of certiorari petitions shape the justices? behaviors? how do external actors, such as interest groups and the media, shape the court?s docket? how does the court?s selection of petitions granted review represent the plurality of public interests? to answer these and related questions, the research project endeavors to collect, categorize and analyze a host of important features in the writ of certiorari process. recognizing the seminal importance of the agenda-setting stage, the research intends to provide a better understanding of judicial decision-making and judicial processes as well as the essential role of courts in american democracy. the research enhances existing theories of judicial behavior, with a specific focus on the early stage of decision-making in the united states supreme court: the decision to grant review, or writ of certiorari. the research collects and analyzes case features from all writ of certiorari petitions? that is, all lower court cases where the losing party, dissatisfied with the outcome, appeals to the us supreme court. the study catalogs?for the first time?the geographic origin, temporal distribution, and issue areas of cases the court is asked to review. it also examines the role played by external actors in shaping the court?s agenda, including the media and interest groups, as well as the extent to which the court?s final selection of cases is consistent with the expectations of the plurality of interests in society. this multifaceted investigation inquires into how these factors collectively impact the decision-making process of the justices, leading to both empirical and theoretical contributions in the study of judicial decision-making. first, it provides new data on writs of certiorari petitions that are comprehensive over time and space, and across issues. second, the project presents a unique perspective on the courts more generally by contributing to theories that are built around informational cues, and by using computational social science methods to test how the selection of cases impacts judicial outcomes. third, it seeks to refine and extend machine learning algorithms for legal text analysis of cert petitions and external actors, potentially paving the way and setting new standards for data-driven research in judicial politics. finally, it supplements the quantitative analyses with interviews of former supreme court clerks and amicus-filing entities to provide a richer perspective on how the justices sort through the large number of petitions received every year, and how the court selects the final set of cases to review. through the research, and, importantly, the creation of a dataset that categorizes a host of features of all cert petitions to the court, this project will provide judicial, interest group, media scholars and the public with new insights on the workings of the judicial system."
Collaborative Research: Multiple Team Membership (MTM) through Technology: A path towards individual and team wellbeing?,"promoting the wellbeing of employees is a critical focus in today's organizations, especially as collaboration increasingly relies on technologies and involves virtual teams. while existing research explores the wellbeing of employees in single teams, there's a gap in understanding how being part of multiple teams influences the experiences and overall wellbeing of individual team members and teams in organizations. this project addresses the relationship between multiple team membership (mtm) and wellbeing, crucial for organizational productivity. individuals navigating multiple virtual teams experience ?context variety.? in other words, they move between diverse technological, task-related, and socio-psychological contexts. this includes using different platforms and emerging technologies (e.g., ai nudging tools), facing varying task requirements, and experiencing different levels of inclusion and psychological safety across teams. despite being a common experience, prior research hasn't explored how team context variety influences individuals? and the entire team?s wellbeing, including both positive and negative outcomes, such as excitement or burnout. this research aims to integrate scholarly perspectives on teams, management information systems, and human resources, contributing to a richer theoretical understanding of mtm dynamics. the outcomes will contribute to improving workers' wellbeing and fostering inclusive work environments. the specific goals of this project are to: a) understand how technology, task, and socio-psychological variety across teams affect individual and team wellbeing when team members are simultaneously members of multiple teams, and b) to help organizations, managers, and employees design supportive workplace experiences. the project focuses on multiple levels of analyses: the individual, the single team, and the meso-level, which is defined as a liminal space across multiple teams within an organization. the research team relies on a mixed method approach, including interviews to capture a holistic view of the lived experiences of multiple team membership of knowledge workers and develop a theoretical model, experiments to granularly analyze technology affordances, and surveys to confirm the proposed theoretical model we develop and to better capture variety in task and socio-psychological contexts."
Collaborative Research: SaTC: CORE: Medium: Beyond App-centric Privacy: Investigating Privacy Ecosystems among Vulnerable Populations,"much privacy research has taken an app-centric approach, narrowly focused on understanding user concerns, if any, with privacy risks of an app and alleviating the symptomatic evidence of the ailment (data leaked by a specific app). this project tackles the privacy ecosystem, an interlocking web of dataveillance that can encompass everything from credit card purchases to location history to communications metadata. the larger privacy ecosystems goes beyond the risks of particular apps and aims to mitigate the multiple privacy risks that threaten people, particularly vulnerable individuals who are both more at risk of privacy breaches and more harmed by their consequences. health is a key context and domain in which a broad view of privacy is necessary. this project goes beyond app-centric views of health privacy and aims to examine vulnerable individuals? privacy behaviors in the healthcare context. it develops and evaluates ways that these individuals can better protect themselves, as well as tools to help healthcare providers support their clients? privacy. through qualitative research that includes in-depth interviews and systematic analysis, this project is characterizing the understanding of risk experienced by vulnerable individuals in the context of their healthcare, taking into account the broad privacy ecosystem beyond individual apps. qualitative research also is exploring the role of service providers, including librarians, social workers, teachers, and healthcare professionals. providing privacy management strategies. through qualitative research that includes in-depth interviews and systematic analysis, this project is characterizing the understanding of risk experienced by vulnerable individuals in the context of their healthcare, taking into account the broad privacy ecosystem beyond individual apps. qualitative research also is exploring the role of service providers, including librarians, social workers, teachers, and healthcare professionals in providing privacy management strategies. the second part of this research involves vulnerable populations, service providers, and privacy experts. participatory design is employed to develop and evaluate a toolkit to support privacy ecosystem management. this research project is developing a freely available privacy toolkit designed for those who provide support and guidance to vulnerable individuals to help mitigate privacy harms. the project is contributing to understanding privacy risk and management for vulnerable individuals and provides a new frame for privacy and security researchers in the study of privacy protection for vulnerable communities."
Collaborative Research: Causal Structures: Experiments and Machine Learning,"to make decisions, people must rely on their understanding of the relevant environment: what are the causes and outcomes of the various forces at play. in other words, in many settings, including economic ones, people rely on subjective causal models (or narratives) to understand the world. such models help agents organize and interpret information, allowing them to make forecasts about the future, and providing them with a way to evaluate counterfactuals. the main goal of this research is to take a first step towards understanding how economic agents come to adopt (possibly incorrect) models and how this depends on the information available to them. the researchers will approach this topic from two different perspectives. the first involves a series of experiments that aim to understand how people?s subjective models arise from patterns they identify in data. some experiments will be conducted in an abstract setting, while others involve natural context. natural context can trigger preconceptions about how different variables are associated with each other that may help or hinder people from correctly identifying actual patterns in a set of observations. the second approach aims to better understand whether news media plays a role in heterogeneous subjective models. the goal is to study whether different news outlets organize and explain the same outcomes using different causal models. a growing literature in economic theory studies ramifications of adopting possibly incorrect subjective models, referring to economic agents relying on such models as ?misspecified.? but, for the most part, the literature is silent on how a person comes to adopt a subjective model to begin with, how such a subjective model may depend on the setting, and how it may be shaped by the person?s experiences. in addition, it is an open question under what conditions people adopt subjective models that are consistent with the true data generating process. the goal of this research is to take a first step towards understanding how such misspecifications may arise and how they depend on features of the data-generating process. the researchers will approach the topic from two different perspectives. a first approach involves a series of laboratory experiments to understand how people extract patterns from their observations. the novel experimental design asks subjects to organize different sets of observations (data) with the goal of making predictions in similar situations. the experimental data will let the researchers understand whether the predictions subjects make in each environment are consistent with them using some model that posits specific statistical relationships between different variables. complemented with ancillary non-choice data that emerges as a by-product of the experimental design, the results will provide insights into how people form models of the world by studying data and how they use these models to make predictions. experiments will be conducted both with an abstract setting and with context. understanding how people come to adopt (possibly incorrect) models and how this is impacted by the information available to them is important to determine in what situations they are more vulnerable to being manipulated. furthermore, it can help us design policies that are effective in correcting beliefs and inducing optimal behavior. the second approach aims to better understand whether news media plays a role in shaping heterogeneous subjective models. the goal is to study whether different news outlets organize and explain the same outcomes using different causal models. to do so, the researchers will use an end-to-end trained machine learning pipeline that will take text (news articles) as input and identify the main causal statements advanced in this text as output. documenting the heterogeneous causal models propagated by news outlets is important for understanding why voters with different political affiliation disagree on the optimal response to problems that are accepted by both sides."
Collaborative Research: Evaluating the Implementation of the Nordic Model of Incarceration in the United States,"the harshly punitive conditions in many prisons worldwide are the target of growing criticism. in the ensuing debate over correctional reform, the ?nordic model? of incarceration is routinely positioned as a less punitive, more humane alternative. with human dignity as a guiding value, nordic model prisons are designed less to punish incarcerated people than to facilitate their reintegration into society after release. the stark contrast between the nordic model and more punitive approaches explains the former?s appeal in the correctional reform debate yet also prompts caution about the challenges to its adoption in contexts outside the nordic sphere. the application of the nordic model in u.s. correctional settings, for instance, may require creative methods of translating seemingly incompatible values, policies, and practices. this research sheds light on how and to what degree the nordic model contributes to correctional reform in new contexts, particularly those grounded in a punitive approach. more broadly, it increases understanding of the potential for correctional innovations that endeavor to change the status quo. attention to the values that underpin incarceration, and how these are negotiated, experienced, merged, and changed, adds nuance to a debate that all too often resorts to irreconcilable binaries, such as prison as usual or prison abolition. this research examines how correctional systems negotiate potentially conflicting principles and values in the course of policy development and implementation and how prison staff and incarcerated people experience these efforts toward reform. the following questions guide the inquiry: 1) how have nordic principles of incarceration, such as dignity, normalization, and resocialization, among others, been translated for implementation in u.s. corrections, in both policy and practice? 2) what are the short-term and long-term goals of the adoption of the nordic model of incarceration? 3) what factors facilitate or constrain the achievement of these goals? 4) how is the implementation of these principles experienced by correctional staff and incarcerated people? the research methods include observation, interviews, and analysis of archival documents and focus on several sites in the united states where the nordic model is being implemented. variation across the study sites allows for the analysis of multiple pathways of innovation in correctional policy and practice. this variegated comparative analysis contributes to the scientific understanding of how change is accomplished in carceral institutions and how that change is experienced. this understanding lends insight into the potential for sustainability of initiatives that adopt the nordic model."
Collaborative Research: Legitimacy and Efficacy of Transitional Justice Institutions in Comparative Perspective,"this study will assess how the design of transitional justice institutions in countries affected by conflict and/or authoritarianism affects public opinion, thereby shaping long-run national outcomes including regime type and conflict recurrence. existing literature on the effects of transitional justice is inconclusive; such work is divided between micro-level, single-country studies and macro-level, cross-country studies as well as between studies of post-authoritarian and post-conflict contexts. by collecting comparable survey measures across three countries that vary along several theoretically relevant dimensions and by building a cross-national dataset, this project will bridge these gaps. further, the researchers will develop and test a novel theory about how public attitudes mediate the relationship between transitional justice institutions and long-run outcomes. given the widespread use of transitional justice in post-conflict and post-authoritarian countries as well as democracies around the world, there is an urgent need for the field of transitional justice studies to develop a stronger base of evidence for policymaking. this project will shed light on which forms of transitional justice effectively promote peace, democracy, justice, and reconciliation as well as provide insights into how countries? unique histories may shape the impact of transitional justice there. this project will investigate three questions. first, which kinds of transitional justice do people see as more legitimate? second, how do people?s perceptions of the legitimacy of transitional justice institutions affect their broader political attitudes concerning the government, principles of democracy and autocracy, and out-groups? third, do transitional justice institutions perceived as more legitimate contribute to peace and democracy following conflict? to address these questions, the research team will draw on their extensive thematic, regional, and methodological expertise to employ a mixed-methods research design which combines survey experiments in colombia, iraq, and ukraine; qualitative evidence collected from focus groups and elite interviews in the same countries; and original cross-national data. this approach will leverage the strengths of diverse methodologies by combining (a) micro-level survey and qualitative data that will enable the investigators to assess the effects of varying transitional justice processes on individual attitudes with (b) macro-level cross-national data that will provide insight into the effects of institutions and historical context on national-level outcomes."
Collaborative Research: SBP: Scientific topics and careers at the intersection: an algorithmic approach,"the goal of this project is to investigate the direct harms to science wrought by structural racism and the benefits derived by the inclusion of people of color and other historically marginalized groups in the scientific workforce. specifically, this work seeks to (a) quantify the participation of people of color and members of historically marginalized populations in the production of science, (b) elucidate their role in propelling intellectual innovations, and (c) understand how the distribution of labor and composition of scientific teams creates barriers and pathways to their scientific success. the project will support the mission of open science, by making the algorithms and publications openly available to propel this area of research. finally, the pi team will recruit a cohort of a dozen student fellows from a variety of disciplines and countries to discuss the ways in which they incorporate their lived experiences into research design and the challenges and barriers to this process. priority will be given to doctoral students of color, or who identify as a member of a historically marginalized population within their country of affiliation. the goal of the fellowship is to empower students to navigate academic spaces by suggesting new topical directions with advisors, to cultivate change in terms of how authors are distributed in scientific publications, and to examine what and how science is conducted. our research aims to empirically examine the degree to which diversity in the scientific workforce creates a more innovative and robust scientific system. the research has strong implications for all sectors of society. this research builds upon previous quantitative analyses to construct more robust and equitable algorithms that take into consideration contextual factors that influence the performance of the algorithm. to address our primary aim we use articles? abstract, title, and keywords to train a latent dirichlet allocation (lda) model to infer the topics within a corpus of papers and the distribution of topics within each article. data sources include millions of articles and distinct authors indexed in the web of science (wos) database. to address our primary aim we will use articles? abstract, title, and keywords to train a latent dirichlet allocation (lda) model and to extend our work on intersecting race, ethnicity, and gender inequalities in the us research landscape to citation and collaboration patterns, the role of institutional affiliation and changes over time; infer the topics within a corpus of papers, and the distribution of topics within each article. our second aim is to determine if variation by race, ethnicity and gender identified in the us context translates to other national contexts. to address this second aim we will replicate and expand our methodology to two other scientifically productive, diverse societies. comparison across all three nation states will allow for the identification of potentially generalizable characteristics, mechanisms that can be used to improve equity in science across the globe, and knowledge of how topicality of research in different countries is affected by the racial composition of teams. this research will provide a scalable methodological contribution that extends beyond the confines of this single research project and will allow other researchers to analyze race, ethnicity, and gender in any dataset that includes individual names."
Collaborative Research: Science and Information Integrity: Strategies for Rebuilding Trust in Science,"public trust in science is declining, with widespread science information integrity issues identified as a key factor. to tackle this issue, extant research and intervention efforts primarily focus on combating fact-level threats (i.e., false beliefs) by correcting science misperceptions or alerting the public to the information integrity dangers in science. yet, emerging evidence indicates that focusing on fact-level threats may unintentionally exacerbate trust-level threats by triggering suspicion towards all science information, even factually accurate information. while trust-level threats are broad, long-term challenges to science communication, it remains unclear how to address fact-level threats without causing trust-level threats. filling this gap, this project theorizes and examines the cause, mechanism, and solution of trust-level threats to information integrity. this project advances theory and knowledge about enhancing the public value of scientific findings and scientific communities and offers evidence-based guidelines for the practice of effective science communication in the post-truth era. this research employs a sequential mixed methods approach. first, a national two-wave panel survey (final n = 1,000) identifies the cause of trust-level threats to information integrity by investigating various experiences and perceptions as potential triggers of declined trust in science. in particular, this research investigates the lie-default bias, a tendency to assume incoming information as a lie rather than truth, as a key mediator between science information integrity issues and distrust in science. second, two online experiments (n = 600 each) test the unintended spillover effects of current approaches (e.g., fact-checking, literacy interventions) that aim to address fact-level threats to information integrity. third, four focus groups with key stakeholders, including scientists, educators, journalists, and the general public (n = 20 for each group), evaluate how empirical findings from surveys and experiments may be interpreted to inform intervention strategies for maintaining information integrity with regard to fact-level and trust-level threats."
Collaborative Research: The Magic School Bus and the Reanimation of American Science Education,"this award, which is this co-funded by the advancing informal stem learning (aisl), program supports a collaborative research project the investigates the development, use, and impact of science multimedia for young children. it utilizes the history of the magic school bus (msb), one of the most successful informal science initiatives of the past forty years, to study the relationship between education reform, children's media, and public-private partnerships from the 1980s to the present. it compares how different media (books, tv series, video games, etc.) introduced children to scientific inquiry in formal and informal settings. the project will generate scholarly and popular articles, online media, a science education roundtable, a book, and the groundwork for a future feature-length documentary. the research team members will use their different disciplinary skills and knowledge to combine archival research, oral history interviews, and media content analysis to address the following questions. why and how did msb take shape as an informal science innovation? how did msb's scientific storytellers work together to pursue their goals? how did msb use media-specific affordances to represent science? what were msb's immediate and long-term impacts? in addressing these questions, the project will study the role of animation as a tool for representing scientific phenomena for children and as a medium for increasing participation of girls and minority children in stem. it will also study the motivations, tensions, and impacts of public-private partnerships in science education; it will analyze how private companies, including scholastic and microsoft, collaborated with nsf and other government agencies in the dual pursuit of profit and scientific literacy. the results of this project will advance scholarship on the history and impacts of educational policy reform and informs educators, science communicators, children's writers, policymakers, and citizens on how creative media can be used as a tool to engage and teach a young, diverse audience."
Collaborative Research: The Militarized Dispute Data 2015-2024 and Beyond,NA
NSF-BSF: Collaborative Research: Market Conduct in Technology Adoption in the Automobile Industry,"abstract antitrust enforcement research has mostly focused on price and quantity collusion, even though antitrust law encompasses more ways to collude. this project will explore the causes and welfare consequences of automakers colluding on the adoption of emission control technologies. the project focuses on automakers that have been alleged to have colluded on adopting diesel exhaust fluid (def) tanks that were too small to effectively clean up nitrogen oxide (nox), a major contributor to air pollution. the project will investigate how the alleged collusion by automakers concealed violation of nox emissions regulation. the project will quantify the effects of the alleged collusion on nox pollution damages, car buyer surplus, and firm profits. these effects inform the proper amount of antitrust penalties to remedy welfare damages of such collisions. finally, the project will examine whether and how environmental and antitrust regulation can mitigate inefficiencies from technology collusion. the project will build and estimate a structural model of consumer vehicle demand and automaker technology choice, and simulate counterfactual policies. the project utilizes a comprehensive new data set on vehicle prices, sales, and characteristics. a novel feature of the employed structural model is that the probability of non-compliance detection for one firm depends on other firms' behavior as well as its own. a more dispersed distribution in choices may cause a regulator to question why some firms need to use large def tanks while others apparently manage with small tanks. by coordinating on small tanks, the automakers simultaneously reduce the probability of being detected by the regulator and make their vehicles more attractive to car buyers (as the tank reduces cargo space, a valuable vehicle feature). with the model and estimates of consumer tastes and automaker costs, the project will conduct counterfactual simulation to explore the following issues: (i) quantify the benefit of strengthening the enforcement of emission standards; (ii) calculate the anti-competitive damage of technology collusion compared to the competitive counterfactual; and (iii) identify the demand and supply conditions most conducive to technology collusion. the project advances the economics research and has regulatory and policy implications on firm collusion, antitrust enforcement, and industry standards."
"Collaborative Research: Understanding and overcoming the impediments to high-risk, high-return science","scientific inquiry involves taking risks. every experiment, every analysis, every collaboration entails embarking on a path whose destination is uncertain and whose terminus could be a dead end. yet, not all projects are equally risky. in choosing what to work on, scientists have the latitude to embrace or avoid. appropriately high risk can bring high return, while excessive caution hampers scientific progress. thus, scientists and the public alike have an interest in encouraging researchers to pursue suitably risky projects, yet investigators often shy away from taking the big risks that may generate the most productive science. this project unpacks the incentives that investigators face when choosing how much risk to take on in their scientific careers. the project illuminates why researchers may shy away from the most promising but risky ideas, and asks how scientific norms and institutions can be modified to motivate researchers to pursue the most promising ideas while still protecting their livelihoods from the vicissitudes of scientific chance. this understanding can help accelerate the pace of scientific discovery, enhancing the public?s return on its investment in scientific research. the researchers develop, analyze, and communicate mathematical models of how scientists balance the competing incentives and constraints that they face when constructing and pursuing their research programs. these models apply the tools of economics and decision theory to the practice of scientific research, and blaze new ground by focusing specifically on scientists? risk-taking and its consequences for scientific debate and the formation of scientific consensus. one component of the research examines how scientists? tradition of preferentially publishing successful projects encourages or discourages risk-taking, and how alternative models for scientific publication might shift scientists? tolerance for risk. a second component builds on recent mathematical developments in the theory of imprecise probability to develop a more expansive view of how scientists navigate the thick uncertainty that defines work at the scientific frontier. the researchers engage closely with funders, research administrators, journal editors and publishers, and other stakeholders to direct the research and share its outcomes, ensuring that the discoveries that the research yields are used to promote high-risk, high-return science."
Collaborative Research: Behavioral Science and the Making of the Right-Reasoning Public Health Citizenry,"this award supports a collaborative research project that investigates how behavioral models in public health produce normative ideas about what it means to be a reasonable public health citizen. behavioral science plays a pivotal, but understudied, role in shaping public health and policy responses to global health issues. at this critical juncture for both public policy and public health in the wake of the covid-19 pandemic, the team will investigate the models of moral reasoning and citizenship embedded in public health behavioral science in the u.s. more generally, this research investigates how predictive and explanatory models for public health behavior also create normative models for moral reasoning and public health citizenship. research findings will be shared in two science and technology studies articles, an article for health policymakers and practitioners, and a commentary written for a public audience. the team will offer substantial training and mentorship to graduate research assistants; convene a practice-based workshop with master of public health students and master of public policy students; and write a pedagogical article about the workshop. this is a project that studies the historical precedents and contemporary practices of behavioral science in public health. the team of researchers on the project will investigate the following research questions: how are normative images of the right-reasoning public health citizenry produced through public health behavioral science? how have these normative images acquired authority in the governance of health? how have these normative images been maintained in the face of resistance to expert authority? the team will employ methods of archival research and document analysis to develop a comparative analysis of principal behavioral models. by developing a theoretical conceptualization of the right-reasoning public health citizenry, the results of this project will serve to reconfigure public health sovereignty and citizenship, and open space for reflection and critical examination of behavioral science expertise in public policy."
Collaborative Research: Precedent-Altering Opinions and Collegiality on the Supreme Court,"this project will investigate the role judicial collegiality plays in the supreme court decision-making process, with a particular focus on how relationships shift when the court uses its most significant powers of altering past decisions and overturning acts of congress. like many americans, supreme court justices go to work everyday and, for a multitude of reasons, work amiably with their colleagues and show respect for their views and positions. collegiality is the key to any functioning workplace, but it is especially important at the supreme court, where the justices regularly engage with each other to resolve the difficult questions that color the court?s docket. yet the supreme court is empowered to alter the legal status quo by reviewing acts of congress or reconsidering its own past decisions, and that power stands to make collegiality the most and least important factor in the judicial decision-making process. investigating these relationships requires collecting past judicial communications and using those papers to study judicial collegiality. by collecting, digitizing, and analyzing data from the rehnquist court, this project will enhance scholarly understanding of the role of collegiality at the supreme court while simultaneously creating a data source that scholars can use to study wide swaths of the otherwise-private supreme court decision-making process. after the analysis is complete, those documents will be publicly disseminated via an accessible online resource that scholars, journalists, professors, teachers, and the public can use to better understand the court, its members, and its work. justice john paul stevens's recently-released papers offer memos, personal notes, and opinion drafts from when he joined the court in 1975 through 2004. these papers are particularly useful for studying judicial collegiality because they cover a period where the court's membership was steady and the justices on that court communicated almost exclusively on paper (1994-2004). this project will collect the between 17,000 and 24,000 documents in the stevens papers associated with the 880 cases the supreme court decided between the 1994 and 2004 terms, digitize them, and then use the texts to study the justices' relationships by examining (1) their engagement with each other during the decision-making process; (2) the tone they take while engaging with each other; and (3) the final voting coalitions. the analysis will also examine if and how judicial relationships shift when the justices consider altering precedent or using judicial review. this project is jointly funded by the law and science program and the established program to stimulate competitive research."
"Collaborative Research: DRMS:Group cognition, stress arousal, and environment feedbacks in decision making and adaptation under uncertainty","to solve complex problems, such as the sustainable use of ground water, diverse people must cooperate to share resources in uncertain environments. this project proposes and tests a model of the interdependence between stress, cognition, changes in the abundance of resources, and group decision-making. the model contributes to the science of group decision-making by investigating how stress (biology) and resources (the environment) impact how groups make decisions. the model seeks to explain why some groups of diverse people coalesce and effectively manage shared resources in uncertain environments, while others fail. the results of the project inform decision-makers faced with complex challenges related to climate variability, public health, and defense by building tools for diverse teams to cultivate systems thinking, manage shared resources, and improve cooperation over time. the project also broadens participation in online education and systems thinking skills. this project develops and tests an embedded model of adaptive capacity (eacm). the eacm proposes that the capacity of groups to continually solve complex problems depends on the ability of individuals to cognize key challenges in a resource system and to converge on joint solutions to those challenges. the eacm couples resource dynamics with individual variation in mind-body systems through the process of group sensemaking. sensemaking occurs when groups create an understanding of their environment and form joint plans of action for cooperation. the project tests the eacm through behavioral experiments and manipulation of stress. formal models of the systems dynamics of group decision-making aid in generalizing the results of the experiments. the project pushes the boundaries of theory by converging the study of cognition with the study of stress arousal in strategic decision-making, generating a more integrated explanation for the biological and cognitive foundations of adaptive teams. the results of the project enhance online education and systems thinking skills for diverse students and teams."
Collaborative Research Data Afterlives: The long-term impact of NSF Data Management Plans on data archiving and sharing for increased access,"in 2011, the national science foundation began requiring that all funded projects provide data management plans (dmps) to ensure that project data, computer codes, and methodological procedures were available to other scientists for future use. however, the extent to which these data management requirements have resulted in more and better use of project data remains an open question. this project thus investigates the national science foundation?s dmp mandate as a national science policy and examines the broad impacts of this policy across a strategic sample of five disciplines funded by the national science foundation. it considers the organization and structure of dmps across fields, the institutions involved in data sharing, data preservation practices, the extent to which dmps enable others to use secondary project data, and the kinds of data governance and preservation practices that ensure that data are sustained and accessible. systematic investigation of the impact of dmps and data sharing cultures across fields will assist funding agencies and research scientists working to produce reproducible and open science by identifying barriers to data archiving, sharing, and access. the principal investigators will use project findings to develop data governance guidelines for information professionals working with scientific data and to articulate best practices for scientific communities using dmps for data management. this project aims to enhance understanding of the role data management plans (dmps) play in shaping data lifecycles. it does so by examining dmps across five fields funded by the national science foundation to understand data practices, archiving and access issues, the infrastructures that support data sharing and reuse, and the extent to which project data are later used by other researchers. in phase i, the investigators will gather a strategic sample of dmps representing a wide range of data types and data retention practices from different scientific fields. phase ii consists of forensic data analysis of a subset of dmps to discover what has become of project data. phase iii develops detailed case studies of research project data lifecycles and data afterlives with qualitative interviews and archival documentary analysis to help develop best practices for sustainable data preservation, access, and sharing. phase iv will translate findings into data governance recommendations for stakeholders. the project thus contributes to research about contemporary studies of scientific data production and circulation while assessing the effect of dmps as a national science policy initiative affecting data management practices in different scientific communities. the comparative research design and mixed methods enables theory building about cross-disciplinary data practices and data cultures across fields and advances knowledge within data studies, information management studies, and science and technology studies."
"Collaborative Research: Time-Sharing Experiments for the Social Sciences (TESS): Proposal for Renewed Support, 2020-2023","time-sharing experiments for the social sciences (tess) provides a platform for social scientists to conduct survey experiments on probability-based sample of united states adults. tess democratizes access to high-quality, original experimental data, thereby putting the power of population-based survey experiments in the hands of researchers from all backgrounds, types of academic institutions, and career stages. tess capitalizes on economies of scale by pooling expenses from otherwise separate studies, and makes all its data publicly available, providing an unparalleled archive of social science experimental stimuli and data that can be used for replications, re-analyses, and meta-analyses. tess accepts proposals from researchers at any career stage across the social sciences. these proposals are peer-reviewed, and the best are selected to be fielded. tess fields projects using the norc amerispeak panel, which is the highest-quality probability-based internet panel available for surveying us adults. because tess performs a large number of studies on this panel, we achieve significant cost savings than what the studies would cost if each were funded separately. tess uses the open science framework to archive all data and make it publicly available, and we will also be working with the roper center?s ipoll database to make tess data even more accessible to secondary users."
"Collaborative Research: State Health, Institutions, and Politics Survey (SHIPS)","the state health, institutions, and politics survey (ships) project will give the research community access to large-scale state-by-state survey data collected at multiple points in time. ships will enable scholars, policymakers, and citizens to explore the evolution of public attitudes about state and federal policies; trust in institutions, policymakers, and experts; economic, social, and psychological well-being; perceptions of domestic and international threats; and a wide variety of other topics. researchers from heterogenous geographic locations, institutions, career stages, and demographic groups will get access to the project?s infrastructure and data. investigators will be able to use ships to identify variations in outcomes due to state institutions, history, and policies, as well as employing cutting-edge social science methods to identify causes of public beliefs. the scale of the project will allow researchers to examine public opinion not only across states, but also among specific subgroups that often evade study (e.g., people with low income or education). the project will engage students as part of the research team, as well as offering curriculum development and hands-on training. ships will generate academic papers, public-facing reports, and make data trends easily digestible with interactive visualization and online dashboards. the main goal of the state health, institutions, and politics survey is to provide high-quality state-level longitudinal data on public opinion, allowing researchers to track and document cross-country trends. the research team has developed and validated an approach that allows for the regular collection and post-stratification weighting of large census-balanced samples from every state and washington, dc. large-scale survey waves with up to 25,000 respondents will be fielded at regular time intervals. the sample size will enable exploring heterogeneous effects and examining outcomes for small, difficult to study population subgroups. the project will also be flexible and reactive to sudden events that could prompt the need for immediate data collection. ships will give scholars access to survey modules and results via a competitive application process. half or more of the survey content fielded in each wave funded by this grant will be designed by applicants whose peer-reviewed proposals have been accepted. successful applicants will have exclusive access to the collected data for one year, at which point it will be made public. the project thus aims to democratize access to high-quality, original multi-wave survey data."
"Collaborative Research: U.S. institutions after COVID-19: Trust, accountability, and public perceptions","covid-19 upended social, economic, and political systems throughout the world. the united states has faced particular challenges due to its heterogeneity and federal nature. the covid states project is a large-scale data collection that includes over-time data from diverse state-level samples. the project tracks state-level post-pandemic recovery, studying topics such as trust in institutions, information acquisition and impact, accountability, and economic inequality. it also documents how federal and state policies affect the populace when it comes to these topics. further, the covid states project provides access to researchers from all backgrounds, types of academic institutions, and career stages through a competition for survey module time and provides a user-friendly website with data trackers for use by researchers, students, journalists, policymakers, and the public. the covid states project conducts over-time state-level surveys from all 50 states and d.c. each survey includes up to 30,000 total respondents, using quota sampling by state. this allows for generalizable inferences at the state and national levels. post-pandemic data provide an unprecedented opportunity for novel over-time and across-space research designs. the project over-samples demographic minority respondents to facilitate study of heterogeneous social groups. this includes data on trust in political figures and institutions, knowledge and information, political evaluations, behavioral adaptation, physical health, economic well-being, mental health, and more. it also contains detailed social network batteries that allow for the study of inter-household and inter-group transmission of health and information. this is complemented by twitter data from survey respondents who allow it. this enables the project to identify information sharing and study political discourse."
Collaborative Research: FW-HTF-RM: AI-Assisted Programming: Equipping Social and Natural Scientists for the Future of Research,"computer programming is essential for modern science. scientists write programs to control instruments, run simulations, and analyze data. however, the programming tools and techniques that scientists use often lag behind those in the software engineering industry. this lag makes scientific discovery slower, more costly, and can lead to unreproducible results. in the past two years, artificial intelligence (ai) tools, such as chatgpt, have revolutionized the software industry. they have been shown to make software engineers significantly more productive, but have not had the same impact on the sciences. the goal of this research project is to develop and test ai programming tools that work for scientists. the research team is developing ai models and tools that support the programming languages that scientists use. they are developing benchmarks to evaluate the effectiveness of ai tools for programming tasks that are unique to the sciences. they are investigating how ai programming tools can help college students study science more effectively. by harnessing ai to make programming easier for scientists, the project is helping to accelerate scientific discovery, lower its cost, and allow more people to participate in scientific work. the project is developing large language models of code and associated tools to support scientists. to understand scientists' needs, the team is running qualitative and quantitative studies of how scientists write programs. based on these findings, they are developing deep neural network models for programming languages that are frequently used in the sciences, such as matlab and r, but are less commonly used in the software engineering industry. these models are particularly helpful for scientists who are not expert programmers; they can turn descriptions into computer programs, and also generate explanations of existing programs. the team is developing models that support the programming paradigms that scientists use, including computational notebooks and programs whose structure is determined by data formats. the team is developing code generation models that can be deployed on private, ""air gapped"" networks, making them suitable for scientists working in sensitive fields, including energy and defense."
Collaborative Research: Science with the People: Collaborative analysis of government data for policy reach and structural change in environmentally contested regions,"this project supports residents to use government data to document and examine patterns of health and wellbeing in their communities. using health data that has been collected by government agencies enables community members to answer some of the questions they may have about illness in relation to the places they live. by working with residents to analyze and interpret official data, the residents? own insights about their health and environment will be augmented by the science they are helping to produce. the project will build researcher, community, and institutional capacity to continue collaborative science work on environmental health justice and health equity beyond the project. the results of the project will be disseminated by public events in which residents are key speakers as well as in press conferences, social media, blogs, and articles. the project team will initially analyze data from government sources, such as cancer registries and medicaid databases, to produce initial health data about patterns of health and illness. in partnership with communities, open collaborative workshops will be held where local people will discuss the initial data and ask additional health questions for the team to try to answer with the data, which the researchers will then share in a follow-up workshop. this iterative workshop method enables local community members to participate in the analyses and interpretation of government-generated health data, making the science more relevant to their lives. the scientific reports produced from these public workshops may be used by local residents to support their health claims towards regulatory and policy change. this process of using community-based collaborative workshops to analyze and interpret government data to answer local questions can be replicated for many kinds of data and a variety of community questions. to facilitate this, the final project deliverable is an online manual explaining how residents in other states or regions can replicate this process to produce their own data analyses from government sources."
Collaborative Research: Direct Lending in the U.S. Middle Market,"abstract the tightening of regulation in the u.s. banking sector following the financial crisis of 2008 contributed to a surge of alternative nonbank lenders and, in particular, business development companies (bdcs). this sector has expanded rapidly over the last two decades. this project will construct an extensive database and conduct the first systematic analysis of the bdc sector. the project will focus on these new lenders and provide insights into an important yet understudied segment of the u.s. economy - the middle market, which accounts for a third of private-sector employment. specifically, the project will investigate the impact of nonbank lending on middle-market firms and economic growth. overall, the project will have important policy implications for the role of financial intermediation in the economy. by constructing a novel database, this project will advance the body of knowledge on nonbank lending. first, the project will investigate the causes of the bdc sector growth and analyze their role in financing middle-market firms. the granularity of the dataset will additionally allow to characterize the borrowers targeted and lending solutions offered. second, the project will use the location information of bdc portfolio companies to estimate the real effects of these direct lenders on middle-market firms and, more broadly, on local economic growth. third, the project will investigate how access to capital markets affects investment activities of direct lenders. finally, since bdcs provide funding to firms without relying on deposit insurance, they put forward a new lending model that may offer an improvement to the current deposit-based banking system. to understand the effects of this alternative lending mechanism, the project will develop a quantitative framework to conduct a welfare analysis of transitioning to a new lending environment."
Collaborative Research: Corporate Net Zero Goals for Decarbonization,"to mitigate climate change, a growing coalition of governments, businesses, and other institutions have adopted ?net zero? goals and engaged in decarbonization, an energy transition process that results from the replacement of fuels with high carbon content by those with low carbon content. this project examines three interrelated questions: why are some companies communicating their adoption of different types of net zero goals while others are not? what activities are associated with net zero goals? what are the outcomes of net zero communication and activities on firms? financial performance and media coverage? this project benefits society by exploring the factors that shape businesses? involvement in the development of the market for clean energy. the project constructs three datasets. first, a corporate decarbonization communication dataset includes all corporate communications related to net zero and climate change mitigation goals for u.s. fortune 1000 companies during the 2015-2024 period. researchers collect these data by searching firms? websites and annual reports and coding corporate communication of general climate change mitigation statements and specific net zero goals. second, investigators collect data on corporate decarbonization activities by applying text analysis to the corporate decarbonization communication dataset and by collecting information from third parties. third, a corporate decarbonization media coverage dataset draws from all articles from major newspapers that mention climate change and net zero during the 2015-2024 period. researchers extract the full text of all climate and environment-related major news articles associated with each of these firms, and filter, clean, and code these articles. these are then converted into annual indicators and analyzed using panel-based statistical methods."
"Collaborative Research:  Varieties of Crises, Elite Responses, and Executive Approval","this award is funded in whole or in part under the american rescue plan act of 2021 (public law 117-2. this project examines four major types of crises -- economic, security, natural disaster, and public health crises ? and how they influence public support for political leaders in contemporary democracies. this is important to understand because leader approval is a key barometer of policymaker accountability and democratic stability, both of which can be undermined by crises. this project analyzes the interplay of four factors which vary systematically across these different types of crises and how, in turn, these shape public evaluations of political executives: (1) the ability of citizens to assign responsibility for policy decisions and outcomes; (2) the degree of expert consensus on effective policy response; (3) how much a given crisis in one area generates acute challenges or crises in other areas; and (4) the extent to which an effective response depends on citizens acting collectively. several data sets including (quarterly) measures of executive approval and crises; the tone and salience of leader messaging about the crises; the media?s treatment of leader messaging; and (monthly) leader approval for a smaller number of countries for which such data is available; and survey-based experiments in three countries are collected and made publicly available. the award supports education and diversity by building the research capacity of a student project lab at georgia state university, a minority serving institution, in coordination with pis at four other universities who will also engage graduate and undergraduate students in this work. puzzling divergences across countries in public reactions to leader responses to the covid-19 public health crisis have revealed major gaps in our understanding of how crisis events translate into public assessments of leaders. to resolve these puzzles, this project advances a unifying theoretical framework that identifies four major types of crises: economic, security, natural disaster, and public health. it then locates these crises on four key dimensions which should condition public support of top officials: the institutional and political context and other factors that impact attribution of responsibility, degree of expert consensus and incentives for politicians to follow expert recommendations, the likelihood and nature of spill-over to other crisis types, and the degree to which citizen action is required for an effective response. the project collects data to test theoretically-motivated hypotheses using: 1) a macro time-series cross-national data set to study the effects of crisis type on public approval for political executives for 48 countries, 2) a high-frequency time-series data set appropriate to test how approval dynamics reflect leader responses, as well as messaging choices and media effects for 18 countries for which this data is available, and 3) conjoint experiments in france, italy, and mexico, countries with different political and institutional settings, to assess the validity of the links between crisis types and dimensions as well as to validate proposed individual-level mechanisms. this project is supported by the accountable institutions and behavior program and the sbe build and broaden program."
Collaborative Research: Intermediaries and Product Selection in the Municipal Bond Market,"abstract state and local governments rely on municipal bonds to finance investments in infrastructure. they are often complex financial products, specifying a variety of special provisions, such as flexible maturities and unique redemption clauses. such provisions in a bond may be tailored to the financial needs of investors and the issuing local government, but they may also make it difficult to evaluate and compare alternatives. using detailed data on bond transactions, the project will quantify the effects of bond provisions on market liquidity, intermediary competition, and cost of local government funding. the insight from this analysis will have implications for policies on municipal bond market structure, the cost of local government funding, and infrastructure investment costs. the project will highlight the impact of product attributes on search frictions in the municipal bond market. the research will document how financial institutions' dual role as underwriters and dealers may affect product design, steering toward highly customized and complex products. exploiting variations in state regulations to limit government officials' conflicts of interests, the project will investigate how special provisions in a bond may increase both its illiquidity and its underwriter?s market power in secondary trades. building on these findings, the research will construct and estimate a model of bond issuance and trades, which accounts for rich heterogeneity in the factors that affect bond design: investor demand, dealer costs, and issuer preferences. employing the estimated model, the project will quantify market inefficiency and discuss policy implications."
"Collaborative Research: Gender, Politics, and Environmental Concern","this project investigates gender differences in how individuals form attitudes about climate policy across countries. the research helps us understand how societies manage environmental risks. climatic shifts have been shown to increase both interpersonal and inter-group conflict in every world region, meaning that mitigating climate change is a matter of national security. understanding how to gain support among those most skeptical in high carbon-emitting economies is key to forming effective policy. this project identifies the material and psychological sources of public support for and resistance to climate mitigation policies around the world. it will develop three new public datasets and associated qualitative materials, encouraging replication and extensions, and contributes to education and research infrastructure. in wealthy nations, women tend to express more concern about climate change than men. yet the gender gap in climate attitudes does not exist in poorer countries. this project develops a new theory to explain how political elites shape citizens' perceptions of the costs and benefits of climate action in ways that vary across countries (by economic development) and by gender within countries. we test this theory by collecting and analyzing four data sets: (1) a 60-country dataset on major parties' climate policies; (2) a 60-country dataset on media references to the winners and losers of climate action; (3) qualitative case studies in seven countries to investigate the development of climate policy frames; and (4) a survey experiment in five countries to gauge how policies that lessen the perceived costs of climate action differently affect policy support among men and women. this project is co-funded by the accountable institutions and behavior (aib) and the security and preparedness (sap) programs."
Collaborative Research: SBP: Socioeconomic Mobility of Young Adults Without College Degrees: Understanding Transition Between Jobs,"a high-quality job paves the way for upward socioeconomic mobility for a young adult by providing more income and career progression opportunities. unfortunately, many young adults without postsecondary degrees spin their wheels between low-wage jobs. this project examines factors less reliant on formal education that may facilitate or counteract changes in job quality among young adults without postsecondary degrees. this project provides insights to workers about personal actions they can take while searching for and adjusting to new jobs to improve job quality. for employers and managers, this project clarifies how job tasks and the work environment can facilitate worker development and reduce turnover costs. findings further inform the design of programs aiming to support young workers moving into better-quality jobs, including programs serving youth from low-income families. this project advances knowledge by developing and testing models that explain how individual factors (e.g., socioeconomic mobility beliefs), family background (e.g., social class origin), and work and nonwork environmental factors (e.g., workplace practices and government programs) drive changes in job quality. the project team is collaborating with the minnesota department of employment and economic development and the new jersey department of labor and workforce development to collect data and analyze administrative records. the project team is surveying workers aged 18-29 without postsecondary degrees and unemployed at the beginning of the study. additional rounds of surveys are being fielded as participants search for and adjust to new job(s) over the course of one year. survey responses are being paired with administrative records. this project extends understanding of the role of behavioral processes during job transitions in intra-generational socioeconomic mobility. this project also contributes to knowledge about the interplay between individual agency and contextual factors shaped by family, work organizations, and government agencies during transitions into early adulthood."
"Research Community Development Grant: Collaborative Research: Knowledge of HIV/AIDS: Expertise, Participation, and the Archive in the Long Pandemic","this research community development (rcd) project brings together social scientific and humanistic scholars of hiv/aids situated within the interdisciplinary field of science and technology studies (sts). the core goal is to support community formation, the exchange of ideas, and to foster novel cutting edge research to synthesize knowledge of this long pandemic. activities will be organized to bridge past findings of social studies of hiv/aids with contemporary trajectories in the field focused around three core themes: the archive, expertise, and participation. social and humanistic scholarship on the hiv/aids epidemic in north america has distinct phases. the period prior to 1996, before effective treatments for hiv, was marked by a wide array of scholarship on the pandemic. however, public attention to hiv/aids experienced a decline and fragmentation after more effective treatments became available ? sometimes with the mistaken rationale that the pandemic was over (or at least well-managed) and coupled to a ?second silence? in public attention to aids. biomedical innovation has resulted in treatments that can enable a person living with hiv to live a lifespan comparable to that of an hiv-negative person. however, antiretroviral therapies are not cures, they come with side effects, require access to resources and stability to remain in care (from health insurance to housing), are dependent on the pharmaceutical industry, and overall, have not ended the pandemic locally or globally. four decades into the pandemic, even as many countries proclaim that they will end their hiv/aids epidemics by 2030, there is no actual end in sight. hiv has become a long pandemic, one that is both exceptional while also overlapping with many ongoing human rights, economic and public health crises. this rcd project aims to overcome the intellectual fragmentation that accompanied the second silence on hiv/aids in sts and its constituent disciplines by creating infrastructure to support a scholarly community around these topics. this project will assemble a productive research community via a series of three annual workshops; by developing an online forum for coordination; by supporting new research collaborations with small grants; and by creating a robust mentorship program that will pair early career scholars with more established scholars. the project will support the next generation of scholars focused on social studies of illness and will seek to develop general insight for both long-standing and emerging pandemics."
Collaborative Research: FW-HTF-RL: Building an Inclusive Future of Work: Accessible Collaboration for Visually Impaired Information Workers,"information workers use digital collaboration tools for project management, preparing and sharing documents and presentations, and team communication and coordination. people who are blind or low vision are performing computer-based work at increasing rates, yet only 44% of the 8.1 million visually impaired americans are employed. while advances in collaboration tools (e.g., shared document editors, video conferencing, and chat platforms) make it possible to work together in new ways and create new career opportunities, these tools remain largely inaccessible for blind workers. more than 2 billion people worldwide use collaboration tools on a monthly basis, yet learning to use them with a screen reader ? software blind people use to read and navigate a graphical display ? is extremely challenging. for example, collaborative writing tools offer only partial access for screen reader users, making it difficult to understand where other team members are working in a shared document. this project advances future ai-augmented collaboration tools and creates a more equitable and inclusive future of work by improving job-related skill development, increasing worker self-efficacy, and providing access to all aspects of teamwork experienced by current and future information workers. this project is grounded in formative research and close partnership with four disability service organizations across orange county, ca and chicago, il that serve as the primary work contexts and both employ visually impaired information workers as well as offer training and placement programs. this research contributes: (1) foundational knowledge of accessibility needs for blind information workers through a taxonomy of accessibility barriers and provides design guidelines for ai-powered collaboration tools; (2) an accessible infrastructure of new interaction techniques and ai-augmented tools that support ability-diverse team communication, coordination, and knowledge sharing; (3) an open-source online community that fosters peer learning and support; (4) empirical evidence of system effectiveness for individual and collaborative interaction, skill development, self-efficacy, and collaboration readiness; and (5) a multidisciplinary consortium that will impact on industry products and policy related to the future of accessible work, ai, and equity in the tech industry. an integrated evaluation plan assesses individual and collaborative interaction with the systems as well as large-scale naturalistic use by blind workers and those seeking employment. to further ensure the project?s broader impact, an advisory board includes experts from industry, disability law, and public policy."
Collaborative Research: The Economics of Port Infrastructure,"this award funds a project in the economics of transportation infrastructure that focuses on the role of shipping ports in international trade. such infrastructure is crucial for the smooth functioning of international trade. because more than 80% of traded goods (amounting to 11 billion tons and about $20 trillion) are carried by ships, shipping ports are the literal gateway to international trade. the advent of global sourcing, whereby firms source their inputs from further away suppliers, as well as just-in-production, whereby firms expect their inputs to arrive at the moment they need them, has made ports even more pivotal in recent decades. this became painfully apparent during the ?great supply chain disruptions? induced by the covid-19 pandemic, which upended supply chains, and generated enormous costs to importers and exporters worldwide, who faced massive delays in obtaining their goods. in this uncertain environment, what are the returns to investing in transportation infrastructure? and how should funding be coordinated and spent? what are the drivers of port performance and why are ports so prone to disruption? this project seeks to provide an answer to these questions, by combining a collection of novel data sets on ports, with a state-of-the-art modeling framework for port technology and demand for port services. the results of this project will be useful for making policy decisions about infrastructure investments, including both where ports should be located, what kinds of investment has the highest returns, and whether or not these decisions should be decentralized. the researchers construct a unique database on global ports that relies on data collected by private providers, as well as their own data collecting efforts. the data includes satellite vessel position data, detailed port charges, as well as union membership. they create a dataset on port infrastructure by manually collecting historical satellite images of world ports from google earth. in order to evaluate the role of transportation infrastructure one needs the following ingredients: infrastructure technology to understand both the dynamics of congestion, as well as how investment in infrastructure affects congestion; and a demand system for transportation services. this is necessary both because demand endogenously responds to infrastructure improvements, but also in order to quantify their welfare gains. using insights from queueing theory, the researchers construct and estimate a micro-model of port technology that takes port inputs, such as infrastructure, labor, cranes, and productivity, and produces output, namely time at port. that setup endogenously generates convex costs of congestion. the researchers then estimate a demand system for port services: potential exporters/importers decide which port to use and obtain utility from lower time at port, shorter distance to their origin and destination, lower port prices, as well as other characteristics of the port. the researchers combine their estimates of technology with their estimates for port demand to estimate the returns to port infrastructure investment. the research advances knowledge by shedding light on how ports operate and how they contributed to the great supply chain disruption. it takes a deep look into port technology and shows that it renders ports inherently disruptive. this also illustrates the role of uncertainty and the impact of different inputs on resilience."
Collaborative Research: FW-HTF-RL: Trapeze: Responsible AI-assisted Talent Acquisition for HR Specialists,"human resources (hr) specialists fulfill a range of critical staffing functions in organizations. this project focuses on supporting hr specialists in the technology and ?big-box? retail industries, who source and screen candidates for entry- to mid-level positions. these hr specialists often find themselves under enormous pressure to fill roles, and they turn to automated decision systems (ads) for managing the meticulous balancing act of talent acquisition: sifting through pools of candidates to find people who meet job requirements and have the ?right? culture fit, while adhering to ethical standards and legal compliance. ai models that match and rank candidates are at the heart of these ads. poorly designed models can produce incorrect and inconsistent results that fail to match candidates appropriately to job requirements, or that limit the visibility of well-suited candidates. together, these problems can lead to unaccountable decision-making processes and unfair decision outcomes, harming individual job seekers and members of already disadvantaged communities, and putting employers at risk of litigation. this project reimagines the role of hr specialists (future worker), empowering them with the agency to reason about, validate, audit, and influence the ads-assisted hiring process (future work context). these interventions are supported by a human-in-the-loop framework called trapeze (future technology) that supports transparent automation in talent acquisition, along with innovative educational materials and methodologies that train hr specialists to become better informed about ai and accountability in ads-assisted decisions. outcomes of trapeze include open-source software, allowing the broad and diverse community of responsible ai researchers and practitioners to build and evaluate tools for sourcing and screening more effectively. this project also advances the understanding of the behavioral, social, legal, and technical contexts in which hr specialists in the technology and retail domains make ads-assisted decisions. publicly available training materials and methodologies from this project help hr specialists become more informed, responsible, efficient, and effective in their use of ads. all shared materials, taken together, serve as a strong blueprint for strengthening accountability in ads use within other high-stakes sectors of industry."
Collaborative Research: Uncovering the Effects of Body-Worn Cameras on Officer and Community Outcomes,"organizations are increasingly relying on technological systems to monitor, analyze, and influence employee work behaviors. one prominent example is the adoption and deployment of body-worn cameras by law enforcement organizations. body worn cameras are small video and audio recording devices that law enforcement officers wear when in the field and when interacting with the public. body-worn cameras have a variety of technological features that can potentially transform officer training, accountability, and performance, and increase or decrease community trust in law enforcement. however, previous findings on the effects of body-worn cameras on individuals and organizations have varied widely. the goal of this project is to better understand how individual, organizational, environmental, and technological factors interact to influence how officers and the communities they serve respond to body-worn cameras. the project collects data from multiple sources to answer research questions about the effects of body-worn cameras. in the first phase of data collection, the project team collects survey data from patrol officers working in nearly 60 agencies that use body-worn cameras. the surveys include measures of burnout, well-being, proactivity, and attitudes regarding their organizations and body-worn cameras. the project team also conducts interviews with high-ranking officers from each of these agencies to better understand body-worn camera implementation in each agency. in the second phase of data collection, community members from each of the jurisdictions that the participating law enforcement agencies serve are surveyed regarding their attitudes about their local agency and about law enforcement technologies. community sentiments are triangulated using by colling data from social media posts using natural language processing techniques. these multi-level multi-source data allow the project team to test a model of the effects of body-worn cameras on officers and communities and create fundamental knowledge about the ways organizations operate in modern digital contexts, building critical theoretical groundwork to inform future design and policy of body-worn camera use in law enforcement organizations. this project is jointly funded by the science of organizations program (soo) and the established program to stimulate competitive research (epscor)."
Collaborative Research: Military Service as a Gendered Pathway into STEM,"the project investigates how gender and military service shape decisions to pursue science, technology, engineering, and math (stem) degrees and occupations. research shows that military service is a pathway into stem fields. the project examines how the timing of educational and occupational experiences shape stem-related outcomes. it also focuses on how the influence of military service on stem trajectories varies by gender ad across demographic groups. thus, the project addresses the national need to increase the number of stem professionals, diversify the stem workforce, and optimize the recruitment of military personnel. findings from this project assist decision-makers in how to finetune military recruitment and assignment strategies to optimize strategic growth and inclusion goals in the armed forces. findings are also important to federal agencies committed to broadening participation in stem, and to employers interested in recruiting and retaining a diverse stem workforce. identifying how military service influences subsequent stem trajectories presents a timely and unique opportunity to strengthen both private- and public-sector institutions. the project pursues a two-pronged approach. first, large-sample analyses involve integrating multiple restricted-use data sources available via the u.s. census bureau?s federal statistical research data centers/fsrdc to construct a longitudinal database spanning more than two decades: decennial census, american community survey, department of veterans? affairs u.s. veterans file, national survey of college graduates; plus publicly-available data from the integrated postsecondary education data system. these analyses involve sophisticated statistical models on large samples based on millions of respondents in the fsrdc databases. methodological contributions involve creating new population estimates sought by the u.s. census bureau and other federal agencies, plus conducting essential robustness checks that test several distinct stem definitions used by federal agencies. second, to examine the mechanisms that shape such trajectories of civilian and veteran students, the project relies on original survey data for a representative sample of current students at a major us university. this original survey compensates for limitations in the fsrdc data by homing in on the impact of specific skills and experiences, including those of student veterans. the survey data are made publicly available via a data repository, to enhance social science data infrastructure, dissemination, and transparency. this project is jointly funded by the sociology program, the established program to stimulate competitive research (epscor), and the science of broadening participation program."
Collaborative Research: The Architecture of Accountability in 21st Century Latin America,"some public officials in latin america routinely act outside the law, violating constitutional rights, engaging in corruption, and ignoring judicial rulings. such unlawful behavior undercuts the rule of law, weakens democracy, and inhibits investment and growth in the region. this project examines the ?architecture of accountability? ? the sets of institutions charged with holding public officials accountable to the law ? in 18 latin american countries since 2000. the research addresses three questions: (1) what accountability institutions have existed in these countries and how have they been designed and reformed? (2) what explains variation in the design and reform of these institutions? (3) what explains variation in how effectively latin american government officials have been held accountable? we use quantitative and qualitative analytic methods to test hypotheses about how political incentives and interests affect the design and reform of these institutions, and how their design influences how well latin american public officials have been held to account since the turn of the century. the researchers will design, build, and deploy an open-source tool that will systematically monitor the on-line sources on which the project draws and alert the project when those sources have undergone change. the project will significantly advance understanding of the functioning and dysfunction of latin american states, and the weakness of the rule of law in the region. the research will produce a large dataset that will be widely disseminated. by broadening and democratizing access to data about critical political and legal institutions, the project empowers original, high-quality interdisciplinary and trans-american research. by demonstrating to what degree accountability institutions have contributed to government accountability in latin america, and what institutional attributes affect their influence, the project informs institutional design, and should have a sustained and positive impact on government transparency and government accountability in latin america. finally, the monitoring tool that the project will develop promises to facilitate the work not only of this project, but of other data-collection projects and databases as well."
Collaborative Research: Extended Family Support and Housing Stability of Youth Over Time,"family rejection is a well-known cause of youth homelessness. this project extends a 1-yearlong study in to a 2-yearlong study to understand how support from extended family members over time shapes pathways of housing stability and safety before youth end up at shelters or on the streets. the longitudinal study documents the roles and practices of grandparents, aunts, uncles, cousins, and adult siblings in providing long-term shelter and housing stability for youth whose parents are unsupportive or ambivalent about their children?s identities and behaviors. the research is innovative in its focus on youth who are experiencing challenges at home but are not yet homeless and in following the youth for 2 years as they transition into emerging adults. the study advances the science on familial social support and homelessness. researchers draw from the study?s findings to engage in outreach to youth shelters and programs and inform practitioners and decision-makers on strategies to prevent youth homelessness. to understand the role of non-parental relatives and how their support shapes the housing stability and safety of youth, this project extends a 1-yearlong study of 83 youth (originally aged 16-19) who are at risk of homelessness into a 2-year mixed-methods longitudinal study. participants were recruited from two states in the southwest united states, including youth in rural communities and from minority groups. original data were collected through an initial interview, 12 monthly surveys, and a follow-up interview. this study adds an additional 12 monthly surveys and another follow-up interview, including a life history of housing instability and family support. researchers evaluate how the forms and consistency of instrumental and emotional support that youth receive from extended family over time influence their sense of safety and housing stability. a longitudinal approach enables analysis of how family support and housing stability and safety shift over time and as the youth transition into emerging adults."
Collaborative Research: SII-NRDZ-SBE: Enabling Fairness-Aware and Privacy-Preserving Spatial Spectrum Sharing,"worldwide increase in spectrum usage has made efficient spectrum sharing an important economic topic. one way to share the spectrum is to allow secondary users (sus) to dynamically utilize the spectrum that primary users (pus) do not use at a particular time and location. it is vital to design spectrum management mechanisms to promote efficiency, fairness, and privacy while preventing collusion. efficiency ensures that the spectrum users who value the spectrum the most end up with it. competition preservation ensures that collusion among secondary spectrum buyers is prevented. in particular, collusive behaviors among sus can result in a lower price awarded to the pu. in the long run, the pu will be less willing to share or sell the spectrum, resulting in this important resource not being fully utilized. privacy establishes that a spectrum user?s private information regarding location or pricing is not revealed, which prevents malicious attacks to a broadband provider or consumer to avoid broadband outages or interference. fairness establishes that similar spectrum users are treated similarly, thus creating trust in spectrum sharing. the research team employs methods from economics and computer science to develop novel spectrum sharing mechanisms that take account of all four properties. the three main objectives are (1) to construct mechanisms that preserve competition while maintaining efficiency, (2) to design privacy preservation schemes that ensure efficiency, and (3) to identify economic approaches and algorithms that meet all four properties. current spectrum sharing algorithms generally focus on either maintaining efficiency or privacy. the researchers consider both of these properties at the same time as well as competition preservation and fairness. the research enhances the knowledge of those studying auctions who are interested in privacy preservation, fairness, and coalition prevention as well as those interested in the implementation of such mechanisms. in particular, in thrust 1, new auction mechanisms include location, in consideration of negotiation power and information availability, to increase spectral efficiency and prevent collusion. furthermore, privacy preservation is a topic that has become popular recently although there are few privacy preservation mechanisms in the economic literature. thrust 2 adds to the knowledge of how to achieve both higher spectral utilization and user location privacy in a game-theoretic framework. novel algorithms for location obfuscation mechanisms and utility functions will be more suitable for spatial spectrum sharing with directional transmissions. thrust 3 focuses on new economic approaches and algorithms will ensure joint competition preservation, efficiency, fairness, and privacy in spatial spectrum."
Collaborative Research: SII-NRDZ-SBE: Bridging the techno-economic gap for the design of spectrum Zone Management Systems,"awards 2332054 and 2332055 fund collaboration between an economist and two electrical engineers who want to use insights from mechanism design to develop ways to share spectrum in the 6 ghz band. the project applies fundamental economic models to analyze markets for shared spectrum. the team will characterize the economic outcomes under different market structure and different spectrum sharing paradigms. this work is tightly coupled with analysis of the institutional and regulatory challenges of enabling market friendly spectrum sharing. access to wireless spectrum is increasingly important for u.s. economic growth. in order to meet the ever growing demands for this resource, new spectrum sharing paradigms are needed and these paradigms need to be economically sound. this project is addressing this pressing need. if successful in enabling greater access to spectrum it will have broad impacts across society, including helping to close the digital divide, enabling new business to emerge, and improving productivity of existing businesses. this research project includes three distinct stages. work funded by a different nsf award has established the cosmos-nrdz effort, which seeks to design a spectrum zone management system (zms) to enable interference-aware spectrum sharing. this approach is based in part on using the spectrum consumption model (scm) framework standardized in ieee 1900.5.2. scms provide a way of characterizing the spectrum needs of different wireless systems, which the zms can then use to determine allocation of spectrum. this new research project addresses fundamental economic issues underlying such an approach, with a focus on spectrum sharing in the 6 ghz band. the team links the core economic theory of market performance into a multi-tier contracting model to stimulate sharing across heterogeneous networks. they are working in three parallel steps. first, they design spectrum sharing contracts that utilize the scms being developed in the nrdz project, resulting in spectrum access agreements (saas). second, they specify and evaluate the performance of different market structures for allocating these saas. third, they analyze the implications of market designs on industry structure and communications rules."
Collaborative Research: Energy Efficiency and Energy Justice: Understanding Distributional Impacts of Energy Efficiency and Conservation Programs and the Underlying Mechanisms,"the adoption of energy efficiency technologies and conservation behaviors has the potential to significantly reduce energy demand and improve people's physical and financial well-being. this is particularly important for households facing energy poverty, who may forgo basic needs or engage in risky behaviors to meet their energy needs. u.s. electric utilities currently offer over 900 energy efficiency and conservation programs that aim to reduce household energy consumption and improve living conditions. these programs either provide information to help individuals change their energy consumption habits or offer financial incentives such as rebates and loans to lower the costs of adopting energy-efficient technologies. there is mixed evidence, however, regarding the cost-effectiveness of these programs, as their impacts depend on factors including income levels, rebound effects, and energy consumption behaviors. unfortunately, many energy efficiency and conservation programs are not effectively reaching disadvantaged communities, and the equity of their impacts is under-studied. there is a need to investigate how these programs can effectively change energy consumption behavior and address instances of energy poverty in households. this project examines the heterogeneous impacts of multiple energy efficiency and conservation programs and the underlying mechanisms that contribute to inequitable program impacts. this project has three parts: 1) evaluating the heterogeneous impacts of four different energy efficiency and conservation programs using quasi-experimental designs, 2) examining how the heterogeneous impacts are related to multi-dimensional energy poverty, and 3) modeling energy behaviors to uncover the mechanisms behind inequitable program impacts. the data include actual consumption information provided by a tallahassee energy provider as well as survey and experimental results. this project not only provides a fundamental scientific contribution to uncovering the distributional impacts of energy programs and their underlying mechanisms, but also has direct societal benefits by helping develop more effective and better-targeted programs to improve consumers? financial and physical well-being, particularly in disadvantaged communities."
Collaborative Research: How online foci shape conversation,"this project investigates the characteristics of online communities that shape the quality of their conversations. social media sites are not homogeneous; they are made up of online ?foci? of interaction -- online communities like groups, blogs, and discussion forums characterized by their stability and bounded nature. in certain foci, conversations are friendly and constructive, in others, hostile and unproductive. the goal of this study is to understand how the different characteristics of online foci ? their cultures, moderation policies, attitudes towards outsiders, and social relationships ? influence the quality of their conversations. findings will advance scientific knowledge to improve a democratic society and help scholars and practitioners imagine and design a more inclusive and democratic online public sphere. this study leverages a large-scale multilevel dataset that covers all public conversations that unfolded during a major campaign across 1,058 topical forums on a popular platform. the data consist of 1.2 billion comments, 8.2 billion reactions to posts, and 2.6 billion reactions to comments among three hundred million users across 7.5 million posts. in addition, the project collects labeled comments to train machine learning models that measure and predict whether comments are deliberative according to two core dimensions: the civility of conversations and meaningful cross-ideological interactions. these data, in conjunction with recent methodological advances in the analysis of quasi-experimental designs, social network analysis, natural language processing, and multilevel modeling strategies, are used to identify the characteristics of online foci that foster cross-ideological interaction and civil discourse and to understand the role online foci play in moderating the impact of divisive, exogenous social events. this project is supported jointly by the sociology, methodology, measurement, and statistics, human networks and data science-research, and secure and trustworthy cyberspace programs."
Collaborative Research: Leader Behaviors and Experiences across Life Domains,"individuals in leadership roles represent a large group of the nation?s workforce, and their behaviors not only affect organizational effectiveness but also influence the prosperity and welfare of people in their nonwork domains. despite their importance, prior research has paid limited attention to the nonwork domain, including family, community, and personal life, contexts that are antecedents and consequences of leadership role occupancy, leadership development, and day-to-day variation of leadership behaviors. this project takes a life-span and holistic approach to analyze how nonwork domain variables, such as community involvement and volunteering activities, lead to and are shaped by leadership role occupancy. further, the project provides critical insights on how nonwork domain experiences might promote leadership development and how leadership development might contribute to leaders? growth and thriving in other nonwork domains. lastly, the project will help to uncover how and when leaders? day-to-day behaviors and their nonwork domain experiences mutually influence each other. these findings will inform business organizations seeking to promote leadership to facilitate their economic competitiveness, and will also inform society regarding how leadership in one context may contribute to the welfare of organizations more generally. we know very little regarding how leadership in one organizational context may influence leadership and work behavior more generally, or the reciprocal relationships between leadership in multiple domains. adopting a multi-method approach, this project will conduct three empirical studies. first, the project will use archival data (national longitudinal survey of youth, nlsy) collected by the u.s. bureau of labor statistics (nlsy 79, nlsy 79 children and young adults, and nlsy 97) to examine how individuals? nonwork experiences and their leadership role occupancy at work influence each other reciprocally. the project will use mixture latent markov modeling to capture and predict the leadership role transition patterns. second, the project will use a longitudinal design collecting multi-wave, multi-source data to examine the interplay between leaders? nonwork experiences and their leadership development processes using latent change score models. the third study takes a within-person perspective and analyzes how leaders? work and nonwork experiences and behaviors are interconnected on a daily basis. the project will conduct an experience sampling study over 10 consecutive days, capturing fluctuations of leaders? work and nonwork behaviors and experiences that are otherwise missed by surveys separated by longer time intervals; it will use dynamic structural equation modeling (dsem) in data analysis. lastly, by triangulating findings of three studies using different methods, the project will promote a more comprehensive understanding of how leaders? work and nonwork experience affect each other across different time frames and life stages. findings from the project will inform organizational theories regarding leadership, as well as life course perspectives that focus on the interplay between work and non-work domains, especially regarding leadership."
Collaborative Research: HNDS-R: SBP: RUI: Differences in Co-authorship across a Global Landscape: The Role of Network Structure in Scientific Productivity,"this research looks at whether the collaborative context affects scientific outcomes differently for scientists in different categories, focusing on the generalizability of network theories. understanding the reasons for disproportionate representation in top positions and different career development patterns is important because science is increasingly a team-based enterprise. theories about how scientists collaborate often assume that everyone benefits equally from their connections with others, but knowledge production is influenced by status and identity in interactive contexts. this research adds to our understanding of how knowledge is created and shared in global collaborative science communities. it also tackles important issues related to the ongoing efforts to increase participation in stem fields. this research adopts a network analytic approach using a large-scale bibliographic database. this database is a comprehensive source for citation information that allows for the construction of unbounded co-authorship networks that include intra- and inter-disciplinary co-authorship ties across time and on a global scale. in a set of three inquiries, the researchers examine differences in benefit from resource-rich collaborative ties, through cumulative advantage, and from tendencies toward homophily (status) in collaborative activity over time and during the peak covid-19 pandemic period. the project also tackles an unresolved puzzle regarding the innovative value of research specialization alongside collaborative brokerage and the interaction effects of specialization and brokerage on innovation and the generation of ?good ideas?. this work has implications not only for scholars of science, but also for the development of science and innovation policy that seeks to bolster the engagement of all scientists in the production of science knowledge and the development of new innovations. sustaining the career development and collaborative relations of a talented and diverse workforce has implications not only for equitable outcomes in science, but also for national and international economic and social prosperity. the project is co-funded by the science of science: discovery, communications, and impact program, the human networks and data science research program, and the science of broadening participation program."
"Collaborative Research: Electoral Systems, Suburbanization, and Representation","one traditional solution to electoral concerns about constituent representation in local government is to abolish large multi-member districts and create smaller, single-winner electoral districts, some of which are designed to encompass minority neighborhoods. while this traditional remedy might help under some conditions, there is a strong possibility that it may not work as well in rapidly changing metro areas. such areas are common, as residents migrate to and from city centers and suburban neighborhoods. some suburban areas have become heterogeneous, while others have become homogeneous. in such contexts, because of the nature of candidate recruitment, the traditional remedy of creating smaller/single-winner districts could backfire and limit the effectiveness of potential remedy for identified representational concern. this study explores the conditions under which minority representation can be achieved in the context of ongoing suburbanization and gentrification. the study will also make a wealth of fine-grained data available to researchers and members of the public through a user-friendly web interface. the study explores the conditions under which descriptive and substantive representation can be achieved in the context of ongoing suburbanization and gentrification, paying special attention to two of the most important electoral systems used for local governance: multi-seat at-large and single-member district plurality. specifically, the project will include a large-scale data collection effort combining population demographics, candidate characteristics, institutional structure, and policy outcomes for 88 municipalities and 22 school districts from 1970 to the present. the project team will conduct representative surveys of voters, elected officials, and past candidates. data will be analyzed to identify the conditions under which minorities run for local office and are successful as well as the conditions under which descriptive representation leads to substantive representation. as time-honored tools for protecting minority voting rights and representation are being invalidated by courts, these data will provide crucial evidence regarding new reform efforts relevant to many urban areas around the country."
Collaborative Research: Using Weather Forecasts to Identify Economic Behavior,"this award funds an innovative research on information economics. it examines how acting on weather forecasts enables agents to improve outcomes that are sensitive to weather. the first part of this project examines how improvements in weather forecast accuracy benefit society by helping people avoid mortality and why the benefits from these improvements differ across groups. the second part of this project tests whether people use forecasts differently when they are aware that forecasts have become more accurate. these types of reactions could be important for valuing persistent changes in forecast quality. the third part of this project uses routine weather forecasts to trace out the geographical footprints of firms? economic activities, a fundamental but heretofore elusive feature of the economy. more generally, this research will further the state of science surrounding the value and utilization of information. it will also inform public policies on investment in information that can improve human health and economic prosperity, including to disadvantaged communities, domestically and across the world. the results will also help to establish the us as a global leader in the use of weather forecast to improve human wellbeing. this research will use three projects to study how ubiquitous information interventions?routine weather forecasts?impact economic behavior. the first project develops a theory-driven method for estimating the benefits of improvements in weather forecast accuracy using mortality events and national weather service temperature forecasts in the united states. preliminary evidence shows that forecasts are greatly beneficial overall, but on average, has differential effects across different groups. the first project seeks to understand the sources of this disparity. the second project tests a crucial assumption underlying many recent information studies: that agents? responses to messages do not depend on their beliefs about the persistent accuracy of information with quasi-experimental methods. the third project takes advantage of the granular nature of weather forecast data to identify the location of firm-level economic activity. this research contributes to the theoretical and empirical understanding of the value of information, including for persistent increases in accuracy and the utility of public information interventions. it will also contribute to understanding how anticipatory behavior may mitigate costly weather extremes that plague society. the results will also inform public policies on investment in information that can improve human health and economic prosperity, domestically and across the world. the results will also help to establish the us as a global leader in the use of weather forecast to improve human wellbeing."
Collaborative Research: Assessing Impacts of a Four-Day Workweek,"a four-day, 32-hour workweek with no reduction in pay is an emerging workplace innovation. this project investigates potential benefits of a four-day workweek for employees, organizations, and the environment. the study investigates how a four-day workweek shapes workers? mental and physical health, levels of satisfaction, and behavior, including household carbon use. reducing household carbon use is one potential strategy to mitigate human effects on the changing climate. the research also considers how a four-day workweek might benefit companies by investigating company revenue, employee absenteeism, and worker turnover. the four-day week may be an important contributor to national well-being and prosperity. the project is the first known major scientific investigation of a four-day workweek with a robust research design. investigators partner with 4 day week global, a non-profit that organizes six-month trials for institutions to adopt a four-day workweek. researchers use a matched pair case-control design with 20 u.s. companies who trial the four-day workweek, plus 20 control companies. the project combines surveys, interviews, and administrative data. the surveys take place across four waves: trial baseline, mid-point, trial end, and six months from trial end, with a survey population of between 1000 and 2000. interviews are conducted twice each with 40 employees or managers and 10 ceos. the study investigates how a four-day workweek shapes workers? stress and burnout, mental and physical health, exercise, sleep, life and time-use satisfaction, work-life conflict, and household carbon use. an intersectional approach enables the study of potentially disparate effects of the four-day week on workers by class, life stage, and demographic characteristics. the cross-company mixed-methods design permits comparative analysis across firms, occupations, and industries, thereby contributing to understanding of workplace flexibility and organizational change. investigating how workplace policies shape carbon emissions may also illuminate how paid work could help to mitigate climate change."
Collaborative Research: Uncovering and Enhancing Pathways to Psychological Safety at Work for Racial Minority Women,"employee psychological safety, or the belief that one can take interpersonal risks at work without fear of retaliation, has been shown to have several health and productivity benefits for employees and organizations. one factor that is critical to building psychological safety is leader behavior. most of the research has failed to consider that psychological safety may be cultivated in unique ways for employees who are members of socially disadvantaged groups, particularly for those in intersecting demographic categories who often experience unique challenges based on their intersecting social identities. given the workforce has become increasingly diverse, building understanding of how leaders can best cultivate psychological safety among these groups of employees is a critical step to fully realizing the advantages of a workforce in which employees feel psychologically safe. as such, the project team is collecting data to support the development of actionable, evidence-based interventions that will help managers develop communication and leadership skills that effectively cultivate psychological safety of employees. the findings will support the development of leader skill trainings in organizations. the primary objective of this project is to build a more comprehensive understanding of the specific contextual factors that impact the psychological safety of members of some demographic categories at work, with the broader goal of improving diverse employees? work lives and helping organizations to retain top diverse talent. across three studies, the project team is interviewing both employees and managers whom those employees identify as having made them feel psychologically safe in the past to gain a better understanding of the unique needs of these employees to build psychological safety at work. investigators are using this information to design, implement, and evaluate the effectiveness of an intervention that trains managers to cultivate work environments that support and enhance the psychological safety of employees."

HNDS-R - Collaborative Research: An Integrated Analysis of the COVID-19 Crisis on Labor Market Outcomes and Mortality,"this research tests an important labor market theory by evaluating the economic and health impacts of unemployment insurance (ui) programs on workers across communities before, during, and after the covid-19 pandemic. the study will assemble a large, detailed, and innovative data set over 20 years from several sources for the empirical part of the project. the first part of the study focuses on take-up rate of ui by various groups, the second part studies the impact of the generosity of ui on labor supply, job stability, and several labor market outcomes before, during and after the pandemic, while the third part studies the effects of ui expansion on codi-19 mortality rates among different groups. the results of this research will substantially increase our understanding of the effects of the ui program on individual, neighborhood, and state-level actors, and help policymakers better respond to future recessions and pandemics. the results of this research project will make significant contributions to labor economics as well as contribute to better design of unemployment insurance policies, hence help to establish the us as a global leader in ui policies. this research project combines several data sets and merges it with individual-level data for all covered employees in california, over 20 years, that covers periods before, during, and after the covid-19 pandemic. this data infrastructure will then be used to investigate three fundamental questions about unemployment insurance (ui) program: how does worker, firm, neighborhood characteristics, and worker interaction affect the take-up rate of ui programs by different groups; what is the causal impact of ui on the cost and benefits on several outcomes, especially on labor supply, employment stability, job mobility and earnings; and finally the effects of ui on covid-19 mortality. by answering these fundamental questions about ui programs, this research project makes significant contributions to labor economics and provides guidance on how to improve unemployment insurance policies to make them more effective. the results could also help improve labor market policies as well as help establish the us a global leader in unemployment insurance innovation. the results of this study will also substantially advance the literature in the fields of economics and statistics, through improved measurement and implementation of new research designs."
"Collaborative Research: HNDS-R: Polarization, Information Integrity, and Diffusion","the aim of this project is to deepen understanding of polarization as the vortex in which misleading statements go viral. the civic promise of social media was universal access to the knowledge needed to inform and motivate broad political engagement on controversial issues. instead, social media have become the petri dish for epistemic polarization ? the division of the public into red and blue realities. the spread of polarizing unverifiable statements over social media erodes the shared knowledge needed for constructive disagreement and allows foreign adversaries to mount toxic communication campaigns with frightening virality. through analysis of old and new social media data and development of new analytic methods, the research in this project brings a greater understanding of the diffusion dynamics of misleading statements. this will be useful in improving the trustworthiness of cyberspace. using previously collected ten-year twitter archive, along with new data to be collected, curated, and anonymized, in this project the impact of polarization on the dissemination of misleading statements in online networks is investigated. the new data set will be the largest publicly available data set of its kind, contributing to future research on this topic. in addition, analytical methods are developed to evaluate the ideological content, veracity of messages, alignment of users, and the structural and temporal characteristics of misleading statement cascades, such as reach, velocity, and virality. what results from this work is a deeper understanding of the diffusion dynamics of misleading statements. this can inform an early-containment counterstrategy that can more effectively identify, track, and neutralize diffusion before the contagion can spread out of control. this project is funded jointly by the sociology program, human networks and data science ? research (hnds-r) program, and secure and trustworthy cyberspace (satc) program."
Collaborative Research: Interpersonal Pathways to Radicalization & Deradicalization,"collaborative research: interpersonal pathways to radicalization and deradicalization political extremism around the world has increased in recent years, representing a global security issue. despite the growing threat of extremism, there is still much we do not know about how radicalization and deradicalization occur outside of the jihadi extremism context. the research team argues that a key driver of radicalization is interpersonal communication on social media, where potential recruits are connected with extremist thought leaders from around the world. however, interpersonal interactions in conversational settings may also have the potential to deradicalize. this project will use social media data to investigate how interpersonal communication may facilitate radicalization as well as experiments involving real conversations to investigate potential avenues for deradicalization in interpersonal settings. the findings of this project will offer key insights for policymakers seeking to limit the proliferation of extremist content on social media and deescalate and disrupt patterns of interpersonal radicalization. this project will conduct two complementary studies to investigate how interpersonal communication radicalizes and deradicalizes via informational and affective pathways. first, the researchers will develop and analyze a large-scale social media dataset containing posts and interactions between extremist leaders around the world and their followers across seven social media platforms, the dataset will be used to examine how extremists use the power of information and affect to further radicalize followers via interpersonal communication. second, the researchers will conduct an experiment involving real-time conversations between moderate and extremist participants to test informational and affective interventions that equip moderates with conversational tools to persuade and deradicalize extremists. the findings of this project will contribute to significant advances in basic research not only on the use of social media and online communication in radicalization processes, but also how interpersonal communication strategies can be used to achieve deradicalization."
Collaborative Research: Ecologies of Participation in Island Karst Science and Conservation: A Comparative Multimethods Approach,"coasts and islands are at the epicenter of two compounding challenges: variability in climate and the impact of development. assessing the full scope of these challenges requires going beyond what is physically visible or on the surface of these environments. this is especially the case in coastal and island environments with karst, landscapes in which water forms a distinct topography including caves, sinkholes, and groundwater aquifers. past and ongoing exploration, scientific study, and conservation work in the coastal karst systems in the us territory of puerto rico (pr) illustrate what is at stake with the study and conservation of karst. while 20% of the united states (us) is karst, it is the source of 40% of the american public?s drinking water. in puerto rico these values are much higher, given that 37% of the territory is karst. drawing from theories and methods in science and technology studies (sts), anthropology, and geography, this collaborative project between west virginia university and the american geophysical union examines the past and current role of mostly non-traditional actors and their volunteer-based organizations dedicated to the exploration, science, and conservation of karst in its varied forms. this knowledge will make an original contribution to the history, present challenges, and future of geology, archaeology, and other kindred sciences focused on critical zones environments in the us. data will include archival information, interviews, focus groups, and ethnographic field-based visits with participants. this data will be used to generate the spatial and social networks undergirding coastal karst science and conservation efforts mostly carried out by cave explorers, scientists, conservation practitioners and volunteers. the sts-informed ecologies of participation framework will inform this network analysis which aims to operationalize the who, what, and how of participation in ongoing socio-technical and environmental change. results will be disseminated in both spanish and english to a broader audience using arcgis storymaps, an effective web-based and interactive platform. these results will not only be valuable for communities living on or near karst systems everywhere, but they are also important for the general public given karst?s national and cultural value."
Collaborative Research: SOS-DCI / HNDS-R: Advancing Semantic Network Analysis to Better Understand How Evaluative Exchanges Shape Scientific Arguments,"peer review is central to the scientific process, but much of it is hidden from those who engage in it. what issues do reviewers focus on? do authors rebut and/or implement some of these comments more than others? peer review is a social process where reviewers and authors exchange competing arguments about the merits of new scientific work. in these exchanges, authors advance new arguments in their submissions, which are critically evaluated by peer reviewers who contest some of these arguments and affirm others. authors then respond to these reviews with counter-arguments, sometimes conceding and other times refuting. this process of peer review - the exchange of argument, evaluation, and response ? is a social, institutional means of shaping what is published as scientific knowledge. this project will systematically depict this exchange process and its variation, revealing how different fields establish socially accepted knowledge claims. we intend to do this by: representing the hierarchical logical dependencies of scientific arguments; discerning distinct expressions of epistemological value; and developing a method that identifies where and when such evaluations are intertextually represented. when these patterns of exchange and evaluation are viewed in the aggregate, they will offer authors, reviewers, editors, and field participants a means by which to observe these hidden epistemological deliberations, to reflect on their merits, and to potentially help participants advocate for improvements in peer review. the techniques we develop should also enable social scientists to systematically study evaluative exchanges more generally, and this approach can be used to see how evaluative norms are practiced in different social and institutional contexts. using tens of thousands of evaluative exchanges and nearly 100,000 scholarly texts of openreview and jstor, we will systematically study evaluative exchanges among peer scholars over the course of three interrelated phases: how authors advance arguments, how peers evaluate and review them, and how authors counterargue and revise their manuscript in response to those reviews. we will apply natural language processing techniques including discourse parsing, rhetorical structural theory, and network analysis to investigate evaluative exchanges in both private peer reviews and public review-and-responses. the work has three aims: first, to discover the semantic structure of scientific arguments and how they vary within and across distinct scholarly fields. this entails understanding the kinds of claims, warrants, and evidence scientists use to debate; how these are interrelated in network forms or structures; and how certain forms in turn are specific to different scientific cultures. second, we aim to discover the latent inter-textual structure of scientific arguments and, in particular, how responding scientists forge arguments that rearrange, omit, or even emphasize the semantic relations of other scientists? arguments as laid out in texts. this entails innovating ?text as data? methods in order to observe and measure discrete connections across disparate texts. finally, we aim to understand the conditions under which scientists change their minds: how their arguments get revised and how resolution is achieved. this entails understanding whether and to what extent argument structures are updated or aligned by counter- or responding arguments. the project is co-funded by the science of science: discovery, communications, and impact and the human networks and data science programs."
Collaborative Research: Southern Lynchings and Children's Educational Outcomes,"stressors in a child?s environment, among other things, can have significant adverse effect on the child?s educational attainment, as well as other possible outcomes. exposure to violence, especially violence targeted at the child?s own demographic, social or faith community, can be a severe environmental stressor. the late 19th and early 20th centuries saw widespread patterns of racially motivated violence, particularly in the south. this project will use newly digitized historical records from early 20th century mississippi to study how lynchings affected the educational choices of local black children and their families using. the research will combine county level lynching data with detailed school enrolment and attendance record of every child in mississippi from 1927 to 1957. this detailed data set, and the exogenous nature of lynchings will allow the researchers to identify how lynchings affect children?s educational outcomes. given the critical importance of education in reducing inequality and progressing toward racial equity in the u.s., identifying how exposure to lynchings affected educational attainment can improve our understanding of the evolution of black-white inequality in the mid- to late-20th century south. the research results can therefore guide policies to improve educational outcomes of racial minorities, hence narrow the racial achievement gaps in the us. this project will digitize and link the mississippi enumeration of educable children, 1850-1892; 1908-1957, a newly discovered set of records created by the mississippi department of education to inform allocation of state education funding across counties. these records include the school enrollment and attendance status for every child in mississippi, biennially from 1927 to 1957, as well as information on the town of residence, school attended, and sibling links. using these unique records, the pis will construct a measure of historical educational attainment that will be more accurate than the self-reported educational attainment variable present in the 1940 and 1950 decennial censuses. the constructed data will allow the pis to observe which children had completed their schooling at the time a lynching occurred in their community. the pis will use the lynching data in the state of mississippi and the constructed educational attainment data to estimate the causal effect of lynching on the educational attainment of different racial groups in communities where lynchings occurred during the study period. the research results can guide policies to improve educational outcomes of racial minorities, hence narrow the racial achievement gaps in the us."
Collaborative Research: Strategic Leadership Systems: How Networks of Strategic Communication and Informal Influence Arise and Drive Firm Performance,"organizational success is often attributed to the elite group of executives atop an organization and their ability to guide the organization into an uncertain future. however, developing and implementing strategy typically requires many members of both upper and middle management to communicate and shape strategy through formal (top-down) and/or informal (lateral, upward) processes of influence. unfortunately, the patterns of communication and informal influence that often arise among upper- and middle-level management groups can pose problems for strategic effectiveness. such leadership failures are common, costly, and cannot be addressed without a better understanding of who will lead and who will follow in the upper layers of organizations. although prior research has examined the characteristics of top executives to understand firm effectiveness, scholars agree that how top managers and middle-level managers need to interact to propel their firms toward greater success remains a ""black box"". this project delves into this black box by advancing and testing new theory related to the multilevel causes and consequences of the networked patterns of leadership and communication processes that emerge in the upper levels of organizations. by studying the complex dynamics inherent in the leadership of large organizations, this project directly and positively impacts each participating organization as well as the aggregate economy that relies on these organizations. this project leverages partnerships with the center for creative leadership (ccl) and the gutierrez energy management institute (gemi) in order to conduct survey- and interview-based research with upper- and middle-level managers from approximately 50-75 organizations from a variety of industries (study 1) and approximately 25 organizations within the energy industry -- an industry that is vital to national interests (study 2). as a recruitment incentive, our research team is providing tailored feedback for each participating organization in the form of an hour-long virtual debrief presentation and personalized report delivered to senior executives. to maximize internal validity, field study results are being combined with a large-scale controlled laboratory experiment manipulating the drivers of leadership and communication networks in hierarchical multi-group systems (study 3). therefore, this research program connects micro-, meso-, and macro-level organizational theories and corresponding research methods in order to address critical and unanswered questions related to the drivers and outcomes of informal leadership and communication networks in the upper levels of organizations."
"Collaborative Research: Conference on Auctions, Firm Behavior, and Policy","this is a collaborative project between the university of oklahoma and colby college. the award funds conferences that will be held in oklahoma and maine. the goal of the conferences is to develop new research collaborations for us scholars, including international collaborations. the conferences will focus on auction economics and network economics. the conferences will stimulate new ideas in these areas of economics. speakers who adopt different methodological approaches will be invited. the conference organizers will target researchers from other epscor states for participation, including researchers from institutions in kansas, arkansas, louisiana, new hampshire, and vermont. students will also participate and present their research in student-focused sessions. specific topics include (i) structural econometrics of auctions and networks; (2) the use of lab and field experiments in the study of auctions and bargaining; (3) applications of auctions to a range of settings, including government procurement, charity auctions, environmental auctions, and multi-unit auctions; modeling discrete strategic actions, especially entry behavior in auctions; (5) public policy issues in auction design."
Collaborative Research: Improving Worker Safety by Understanding Risk Compensation as a Latent Precursor of At-risk Decisions,"workers may fall prey to certain cognitive biases as shortcuts that result in judgment errors and risky decisions, such as risk compensation. the risk-compensation bias argues that individuals adjust their at-risk behaviors to achieve a balance between potential risks and benefits and thereby maintain a target level of risk. derived from external (e.g., task or environmental-related) and internal (e.g., individual characteristics) sources, risk compensation ultimately influences an individual?s (deliberative, affective, and experiential) risk perception as a central predictor of health and safety-related behaviors and certain risky decisions. decision making under risk is mainly studied at the individual level in the construction-safety setting. however, drawing on social influence and behavioral intention theories, coworkers? risk-taking serves as an ?extra motive? of risk-taking behavior among workers in the workplace. thus, studying the risk-compensation effect in the construction environment can become more complicated given that construction workers work in groups, and coworker behavior can influence safety-related behavior. furthermore, the effects of heat exposure and subsequent heat stress might translate into an increased risk of injury caused by physical discomfort, fatigue, and reduced vigilance that can influence worker emotional state and risk perception, and lead to cognitive failure, misperceiving hazards, and neglecting precautionary behavior. accordingly, this multidisciplinary project addresses these gaps by integrating psychological science, artificial intelligence (ai), and advances in construction safety to deliver a novel theoretical platform and empirical process to understand the latent changes in worker decision dynamics following an intervention for greater protection from injury. the specific objectives of this study are to (1) examine the extent to which individuals? characteristics and psychological states, along with task and environmental factors (e.g., time pressure, extreme heat) influence workers? at-risk decisions; (2) determine the role of risk compensation bias on team risk perception, decision making, and work behavior; and (3) develop a multidimensional ai model to identify at-risk workers and interpret their risky decision-making, using limited attributes including individual, task, and environmental-related factors. to achieve these objectives, a multi-sensor immersive 360 mixed-reality environment that consists of passive haptics and environmental modalities is used to raise the workers? sense of presence, capture their realistic responses to safety features during various current and future construction tasks. a combination of qualitative and quantitative measures serve to investigate the underlying mechanisms of workers? risk-compensatory behaviors and decisions. the measures derive from location-tracking sensors, vision-based sensors, wireless neuropsychological and cognitive brain monitoring (fnirs), eye-tracker, photoplethysmography (ppg) and galvanic skin response (gsr) psychophysiological sensors, semi-structured interviews, demographic, and psychographic surveys. the collected data constitutes information about workers? behavioral changes simulated using agent-based modeling, and used to develop a multidimensional predictive model to minimize the likelihood of risk compensation and to prevent incidents and injuries. the project outcomes have the potential to impact the performance of a nationwide industry and create a novel platform for enhancing the national research and education infrastructure. they advance protection mechanisms for thousands of american workers and save estimated billions of dollars in financial costs per year in the united states."
RAPID/Collaborative Research: Households' Immediate Protective Actions and Trade-Off Processes Between Property Security and Life Safety in Response to 2022 Hurricane Ian,"in recent years, increased climate change together with rising populations in coastal communities has exposed residents to escalating risks of destructive extreme weather events such as hurricanes. these threats are increasing the urgency of conducting studies on coastal households? risk perceptions and behavioral responses that could improve policies to protect lives and property. despite decades of progress, hurricane evacuation studies still lack an adequate understanding of households? decisions about the trade-offs between property protection and life safety among alternative protective actions. hurricane ian was a category 4 storm with a last-minute intensification and track-change that affected a wide range of communities with diverse socio-demographic characteristics. this hurricane presents a unique opportunity to study how households dealt with conflicting objectives in their protective action decision making and why they delayed evacuating or even refused to leave. this grant for rapid response research (rapid) project enhances scientific knowledge of households? emergency responses to hurricane threats by extending the protective action decision model (padm) and gathering critical data in two coastal counties and one inland county in florida. the outcomes promote teaching, training, and learning; increase the participation of underrepresented groups; and significantly improve emergency management and community resilience across the us coastal areas. this project addresses four current limitations in the evacuation literature: 1) risk communication challenges amid rapid changes in hurricane characteristics; 2) the low accuracy in predicting protective action decisions based on linear statistical approaches; 3) an inadequate understanding of households? decisions in the context of buildings? vulnerabilities to extreme environmental conditions (e.g., the actual strength of houses against hurricane-force wind speeds); and 4) ignoring tradeoffs among protective action alternatives during the evacuation decision-making process. to tackle these research challenges, this project gathers ephemeral data on housing damage and empirical data regarding households? experiences and perceptions. the five tasks include 1) field investigation; 2) household survey; 3) comparison of respondents? perceptions against risk levels as evaluated by experts; 4) comparison of conventional linear regression analyses and machine-learning-enhanced logistic regression models; and 5) development of a trade-off model of decision making among multiple protective actions. this project advances the state of knowledge about households? protective action decision making and tradeoffs among protective action pa alternatives in response to a hurricane emergency."
"Collaborative Research: RUI: Dynamic Learning in Comparative Courts: A Cross-National Analysis of Judicial Decision Making in Canada, the United States, and the United Kingdom","common law intermediate appellate courts have typically functioned well out of the limelight and out of public scrutiny. in recent years, however, the number of appeals within common law judiciaries have significantly increased while the number of cases heard by high courts has remained relatively stable. in light of burgeoning caseloads, the intermediate appellate courts effectively serve as the court of last resort for the vast majority of judicial appeals. this project develops, assesses, and advances a new and innovative theoretical framework on the dynamic transmission of information between two tiers of courts across the judiciaries of canada, the united states, and the united kingdom. this study represents the first comprehensive assessment of hierarchical influences on judicial decision making within a comparative context. specifically, this project explores hierarchical interactions between lower intermediate appellate court judges and their high court counterparts in canada, the united states, and the united kingdom. the comparative focus of this project presents scholars, policymakers, and practitioners with exciting, innovative, and new opportunities to explore how ideological and institutional differences within judicial systems and different tiers of the judiciary can influence decision making. this project also contributes to a broader understanding of courts in a comparative context by illustrating that scholars cannot easily assume that frameworks developed for american courts are automatically transportable to other countries. beyond contributions to the academic sphere, the proposed project has broad policy and social impacts. understanding how judges behave in this dynamic decision making process is necessary for understanding how law and policy is developed and how institutional designs seemingly condition judicial decision-making behavior. the extensive data collection, both quantitative and qualitative, for the project will facilitate the sharing of a vast database of information on appellate courts and hierarchical responses to supreme court precedents for a variety of future analyses. the database of intermediate court decisions assembled for this project provides a valuable supplement to the national high courts database. the combination of new and reliable data on two tiers of the courts has the potential to foster extensive new analyses for academic faculty, students, and legal professionals. by providing comparable data on the intermediate courts over a substantial period of time, this study will create a rich resource that will enable future research on judicial policy making in a variety of settings. such data will benefit both established scholars as well as their students including doctoral students throughout related disciplines seeking data for comparative judicial dissertation projects. this project also incorporates the insights gained from in-depth interviews with judges to provide a more nuanced understanding of the way judges understand their approach to decision making. these resources hold significant promise for many analyses beyond this project."
Collaborative Research: EAGER: Cross-platform Election Advertising Transparency Initiative,"nearly $2 billion was spent on digital advertising in the presidential general election in 2020, and online advertising is only expected to grow. campaigns? rapid shift to digital, however, has caused headaches for those who track political advertising. the data provided by online platforms, such as facebook and google, come in different formats, contain different collections that are not immediately comparable, and lack metadata necessary to find all ads related to a specific campaign for office, all ads featuring a specific candidate, or all ads within either set that discuss a specific issue. the sheer volume of content requires the use of computational methods to extract the information necessary to answer even basic descriptive questions such as how much money was spent online in a particular race or across all federal races. this project provides the infrastructure necessary to answer critical questions about the role of digital advertising in american democracy, including the extent to which ?dark money? dominates campaigns, and the spread and reach of misinformation in campaigns. the project team is building expandable infrastructure to acquire, process, integrate, label, and distribute digital election advertising data from two large online platforms. the result is a centralized repository that provides robust documentation of all procedures and code such that they can be modified to apply to other platforms and contexts for expansion. cross-platform integration and standardization of digital election advertising data through human and state-of-the-art computational methods reduces costs to individual researchers, provides parallel procedures already in place for analyzing tv advertising (and thus maximizing comparability to existing data), provides linkage information to other data sources, and produces accessible data to benefit the community. accomplishing this aim is a high risk-high reward endeavor. for instance, new approaches or methods are needed to capture and label relevant advertising by focus, especially when the true sponsor is unclear or disguised."
Collaborative Research: Ethical Considerations in Three-Dimensional Digitization of Indigenous Heritage,"three-dimensional digital models are increasingly prevalent in preserving tangible and intangible aspects of indigenous material heritage. yet, there are no comprehensive, clearly laid-out best practices that can guide researchers, indigenous communities, and museum personnel in designing ethically sound and socially engaged 3d heritage preservation projects. the use of 3d technologies for heritage preservation and providing public access to digital 3d collections is well-established in the european context. while there have been several robust efforts on digitizing european national heritage, in the u.s. context, the focus often involves work with indigenous heritage, instantly placing 3d projects into a post-colonial research paradigm with a complex set of ethical ramifications. this research examines emerging thoughts from the european context and connects them with best practices in digital indigenous data management to identify practices that contribute to cultures of academic integrity that are inclusive of all stakeholder voices. this work fosters ethical cultures of stem through the development of a comprehensive responsible conduct of research guiding document that can be adapted to address culture-specific indigenous perspectives as well as project-specific challenges in future 3d heritage preservation endeavors. project goals are accomplished through workshops and virtual collaborations that bring together researchers, indigenous community members, and heritage preservation professionals with previous experience in the responsible management, protection, and sharing of indigenous digital data and the use of 3d technology for heritage preservation. the collaboratively produced guidelines outline ethical considerations that can be used in developing: 1) partnerships with origin/descendant communities, 2) institution- and collection-specific museum policies on using 3d technology, 3) tribal policies for culturally appropriate use of 3d technologies, and 4) training material and curriculum that integrates with other research compliance regulations pertaining to heritage preservation. the project explores the questions that have emerged through previous experiences using 3d technologies to preserve indigenous ancestral heritage. these questions include the factors contributing to developing ethically sound 3d heritage preservation projects; the practices useful in 3d projects to foster a culture of integrity that equally engages academic and indigenous perspectives; consideration for what constitutes responsible conduct of research in using 3d technologies to preserve indigenous cultural heritage; and addressing practice-based questions that contribute to understanding ethical challenges in digitally preserving and presenting indigenous heritage. the project situates 3d modeling and heritage representation as part of the larger discourse on decolonizing core methodologies in museum management and anthropological collection practices. results from this work can be adapted to training future researchers and digital heritage management professionals and creating meaningful partnerships in heritage documentation. this research cultivates cultures of academic integrity by informing heritage management policy on the critical importance of heritage ethics for the creation and management of 3d digitization projects involving indigenous collections. this award is funded by the directorate of geosciences and the directorate of education and human resources."
Collaborative Research: Robo-advising and Decision Making under Risk,"algorithmic-based advice, a.k.a robo-advice, is disrupting the access to and delivery of advice regarding industries ranging from medical services to personal-shopping to financial advising and wealth management. understanding the processes through which robo-advising affects individual decision-making is critical if we are to design advisors to benefit investors through better and tailored advice and to appropriately shape public policy with respect to the use of robo-advising. this project aims to study the effects of adopting robo-advice on the quality of decisions individuals make. the project will further the scientific knowledge about the cognitive and social impact of new technologies in the realm of professional advice to non-experts. this project aims to study the following aspects of the relationship between robo-advising and decision-making under risk: (i) the extent to which robo-advising might correct well-documented behavioral biases in decision-making under risk; (ii) the extent to which robo-advising can improve over that provided by human financial advisers; and (iii) how individual investors' algorithm aversion makes human and robo-advice complementary, in which case robo-advising may increase rather than decrease the scope for human financial advice. to address the first question, the authors will employ several empirical techniques that range from linear regression to machine learning and artificial intelligence semi-parametric methods like boosted regression trees (brt). for the second question, the authors will analyze the results of a randomized control trial involving the introduction of a tool to relax the attention constraints of financial advisers at a brokerage house. to address the third question, the authors will assess (i) whether, once given the option to access robo-advice, investors access it autonomously or reach out to human advisers for guidance; and (ii) whether, once investors start to use robo-advice, they reduce their reliance on human advisers."
Collaborative Research: Enabling SBE Science via the Network for Transformative Research,"this project supports an ongoing collaborative effort between jackson state university (jsu), the university of illinois urbana-champaign (uiuc), the american indian higher education consortium, and the hispanic association of colleges and universities to implement the network for transformative research (ntr) as a model to generate multi-institutional, transdisciplinary research collaborations that address emergent societal challenges. the ntr builds on the research team?s prior success nucleating diverse teams and enabling them to secure federal funding to address sbe relevant research challenges. the ntr will provide participants with intellectual resources and training to negotiate the barriers known to inhibit diverse, inter-institutional scientific collaboration. the ntr has potential to germinate transformation by: (1) providing opportunities for early career researchers at minority-serving institutions (msis) and smaller institutions to form diverse research teams, (2) facilitating the capacity of institutions with limited infrastructure to develop and sustain research programs, (3) harnessing the problem-solving potential of teams that are diverse across multiple dimensions, and (4) implementing an agile mechanism for generating research driven by institutions serving communities often most affected by societal challenges. the ntr will engage in three primary activities, managed by jsu: (1) recruiting scientists from network institutions to participate in cohorts through the germination process developed in prior work involving collaboration between jsu and uiuc, (2) fostering institutional capacity development by engaging administrators across participating institutions, (3) instituting ongoing evaluation of ntr activities to improve processes and to develop generalizable practices for the broader research community. the initial cohort for the ntr will include faculty selected from universities located throughout mississippi, to ensure representation from msis, small, non-research-focused rural institutions, and research-intensive universities. the proposed project supports the recruitment and management of two cohorts of researchers who will develop interdisciplinary research projects centering on: (1) food insecurity, and (2) natural disaster resilience. each of these topics has been identified by participating institutions as an area of dire attention to the communities constituting the state of mississippi. the ntr will refine sustainable methods for accelerating the development of social, behavioral and economic research capacity at msis. the project extends a previously developed scalable model for broadening participation in science by bringing resource-challenged institutions into the broader research landscape and expanding collaborative networks and capacity within and among participating institutions. the model involves a comprehensive set of interventions (whose designs are grounded in research findings from the science of team science, communication studies, and organization studies) that includes formation of diverse scientific teams, facilitated project management, and fostering of a collaborative culture at both research-intensive institutions and institutions having limited research infrastructure. the model being employed incorporates elements of collaborative problem-solving, distributed research coordination and adaptive systems theory to generate a comprehensive approach to research capacity-building that is both scalable and sustainable. researchers at uiuc will use mixed-methods evaluations (including surveys, qualitative interviews, and field observations) to analyze participants? experiences and to develop tested and scalable methods to overcome systemic barriers to the creation of diverse, successful research teams. the project also included support for external evaluators to assess the ntr?s programs."
Collaborative Research: FW-HTF-R: Mobilizing Nonprofit Resources and Talents with a Community Tool for Purpose-Driven Work,"this project is iteratively designing, assessing, and refining a community tool that provides a new way for nonprofits to obtain the necessary resources and talents to support their purpose-driven needs. this platform can increase the collective impact of small-to-medium nonprofit organizations that provide critical social and human services, particularly for historically marginalized and low-income communities. partnering withnnonprofits, this project integrates the experiences of impacted workers into the iterative design and assessment process. through a collective impact framework, the project aims to ensure that the platform remains a community tool that honors the time and talents of nonprofit workers and enables nonprofit organizations to share talents and resources in an inclusive, scalable, and fair way over time. the research team is measuring its transformative impact on workers, nonprofits, and the community and is studying nonprofit workers? inter-workplace mobility experiences, pursuit of meaningful work, and sense of belonging and purpose. this project convergently brings together expertise in domains including mechanism design, community engagement, collective impact, applied ethics, nonprofit leadership, combinatorial optimization, and law. new mechanisms are being developed to conduct recurrent multilateral combinatorial exchanges, enabling nonprofits to temporarily acquire new resources by mobilizing their own in conjunction with stored credits. these are being informed by rigorous rules of engagement that are inclusive, fair, and scalable. each recurrent episode features an exchange of offered resources, using combinatorial optimization to reallocate both resources and credits in a way that maximizes collective community value. rules of engagement are being co-designed using community-based participatory action research. an inclusive development process iteratively integrates both quantitative technology feedback and qualitative feedback reflecting the experiences of mobilized workers and nonprofit leaders. in addition, a framework is being developed to measure the transformative impact and to illuminate the influence on workers? sense of belonging and purpose, as well as workers? confidence in their roles as change agents and their pursuit of meaningful work; the extent to which nonprofits? capabilities for organizational priority-setting and planning are transformed; and how enabled inter-workplace mobility can lead to new professional development opportunities and talent retention in the local community. finally, this project is exploring the potential for technology to serve as the backbone support for the theoretical framework and engender further cooperation within the nonprofit community."
"Collaborative Research: Women as Leaders, Policy-Makers, and Symbols","women have long been denied access to the most powerful political posts, particularly prestigious cabinet positions within the executive branch. this project examines the causes and consequences of women?s exclusion from, and appointment to, three of the most powerful cabinet posts: defense, interior/home affairs, and foreign affairs. these prominent positions policy influence and it is thus vital to explain when, why, and how women access these portfolios, as well as to understand how women?s inclusion shapes policies that are central to the functioning of the state. the central claim of this project is that women?s presence in political office shapes, and is shaped by, beliefs about the policy responsibilities of the position. though each of the portfolios studied has distinct responsibilities, they share a focus on security (i.e., protecting the state from domestic and international threats). the first set of hypotheses posits that women access the inner cabinet when the portfolios? focus expands beyond traditionally masculine policy arenas (such as terrorism and war) to emphasize issues like peacekeeping and human rights. the second set of hypotheses suggests that male and female ministers? policy priorities are largely explained by the conditions that bring women into (or keep them out of) office, rather than innate gender differences. the third set of hypotheses posits that the appointment of female ministers affects citizens? beliefs about the aims and prestige of these positions and informs their levels of trust and confidence in the minister, the ministry, and the state. this project thus advances the scientific study of women?s political representation by collecting original data to test these hypotheses. this project offers the first worldwide study of women in the inner cabinet and a framework for assessing the causes and consequences of women?s access to male-dominated posts in other realms. in doing so, the project develops a new framework for explaining when women access traditionally masculine domains and how their pathways to power affect policy outcomes and citizens? relationship to the state, we well as compiles a global database on women?s cabinet appointments and policy outputs."
"Collaborative Research: The Role of Elites, Organizations, and Movements in Reshaping Politics and Policymaking","arguably, the current political climate is the function of three seemingly distinct, yet interrelated, ongoing phenomena: (1) a contentious, problem-laden political environment, (2) grassroots organizations driving unprecedented levels of engagement and turnout, and (3) national movements driving discourse, preferences, and reform around long-held policy grievances. the combination of contentious politics and an energized electorate can result in record turnout despite a raging pandemic. the pis examine how these features of the american polity shape public and institutional political behaviors. the project aims to build a network, and supportive infrastructure, to better understand how political elites, organizations, and movements in key political locations work to drive participation, preferences, and policymaking. the project examines two broad research questions. the first question is: how do organizations and social movements mediate political preferences and policy agendas amongst the mass public? second, it is interested in the collaboration between organizations and social movements and how these interactions shape traditional and untraditional forms of political participation. the study draws on a comprehensive mixture of quantitative (surveys, survey experiments, voter data analysis, social media analysis, and social network analysis) and qualitative (ethnographic observations, content analysis, elite interviews, and focus groups) methodological approaches to answer these questions. this study examines political activities during two electoral periods in several transformative states and municipalities. the broader impacts of the study are numerous. first, it connects a network of scholars from a diverse set of institutions. the project builds critical infrastructure at partner institutions to facilitate data collection and analysis. namely, it (1) builds mobile research labs designed to conduct rapid response surveys during protests and organizational rallies, and (2) establishes data analysis centers at two minority serving institutions, and (3) provides cutting-edge training, tools, and professional resources to students from marginalized and underserved groups."
Collaborative Research: Local Government Officials and the Management of Religion-State Relationships,"the day-to-day management of interaction between religion and government falls to hundreds of thousands of local officials, who are entrusted with decisions that impact all american citizens. this mixed-methods, nationwide study of local officials investigates how local government officials, across diverse communities, understand and manage religion-state relations. this project is designed to help the public understand how local officials can support pluralism and resolve conflicts in local communities. the project produces a public-use dataset and trade book, and it supports the participation of women and underrepresented minorities in science. this study addresses the interaction of religion and government through a large-scale survey and in-depth interviews with elected officials. the survey is of 2500 local officials, both elected and appointed, asking about their attitudes and actions regarding religion, the state, and interaction between the two. the survey is nationally representative of officials across three forms of government (municipalities, counties, and school districts) and five governance domains (administration, policing, public health, zoning, and education). the project also includes in-depth interviews with 150 local officials sampled from the survey based on their (non)religiosity and local context. the quantitative and qualitative data are merged and analyzed, resulting in a methodological report, a public-use dataset, and research findings. the study provides the first empirical portrait of local officials? interactions with and preferences about religion, and it examines how those religion-state preferences are patterned by key individual factors (beliefs, affiliations, background) and contexts (region, municipal size, local demography). ultimately, the research demonstrates how government officials, who often have ample discretion but limited formal guidance when it comes to religion, make decisions about how to navigate and manage religious questions and resolve potential conflicts."
"Collaborative Research: RUI: Bank type, bank market ecologies, and support of small businesses","american banking has long denied credit to borrowers in poor and marginalized communities. yet that system contains a striking variety of lending organizations, ranging from global corporate behemoths to community banks, credit unions and community development institutions, that embrace very different business models missions and values, and that relate to borrowers and communities, including poor and traditionally marginalized minority ones, in very different ways. this project analyzes that organizational variety and its impact in the paycheck protection program (ppp) to determine how differences in lending organizations and the ecologies or mixes of lenders that populate banking markets shape?and might enhance?access to credit for small business in poor and non-white communities. ideally suited for this study, the ppp was a federal government program that worked though the nations? existing lenders to issue nearly 12 million loans to businesses to keep workers on payroll during the pandemic, and produced detailed data on where and to whom lenders lent. to address the impact of lender organizational form and bank market ecologies on credit flows, this project combines interviews of lenders and borrowers with multi-level quantitative analyses of a new data set on all ppp loans that links: a) data on lending by seven lender types and socio-economic conditions in 32,000 communities, with b) data on the organizational compositions of 625 regional banking markets that served those communities. these analyses contribute broadly to understanding how organization shapes inequality, while extending organizational ecology and institutional research on organizational form and complexity to new outcomes. they address a key gap in our knowledge of class and ethno-racial divides in banking and credit, integrating work in organizational studies, economic sociology and political economy on bank organization, banking systems and their economic impacts with research in sociology, law and allied fields, which extensively analyzes banking and credit as sites of discrimination and segregation, but commonly sets organizational variety in banking aside (or focus on large banks) to document broader systemic tendencies. and by identifying possibilities for greater inclusivity within american banking?and in government programs that work though that system ? this project highlights new avenues for reform, including building the capacities of lenders that engage traditionally marginalized communities and altering mixes of institutions in regional markets."
"Collaborative Research: Should Regulators Have Independence from Political Pressures? Politics, Banking, and Bankruptcies During the Progressive Era, 1890s to 1920s","should government regulators, particularly those that supervise financial institutions, be subject to the whims of politicians, who might demand actions in their personal or partisan interests, or should regulators operate independent of politicians in the short run? independent regulators are appointed by politicians to accomplish tasks defined by legislatures but can only be fired for ?good cause,? which means that the regulators serve their terms in office as long as they fulfill their duties and do not violate the law. today, regulatory independence is the norm. it forms a cornerstone of the financial system. all federal agencies that regulate banks, like the federal deposit insurance corporation and federal reserve system, operate independently. questions, however, have been raised about the effectiveness and constitutionality of regulatory independence. the effectiveness of regulatory independence is difficult to study today. so, we study historical analogies, particularly during the progressive era, when u.s. state governments experimented with the structure of regulatory agencies and transitioned from politically independent to politically dependent regulators. to assess the impact of these political experiments, we gather new data that will allow scholars to better understand the history of the progressive era and the impact of government intervention on the financial system and rest of the economy. this research will examine how political control of bank supervision affected financial institutions and firms, and how financial and political instability contributed to the spread of political polarization during the progressive era. to answer these questions, the project will build a new dataset on business and bank foundation and failure rates by state and quarter from the 1890s through the 1930s as well as the aggregate liabilities and assets of these institutions. the project will also build a new dataset on the structure of financial regulation in the 50 states. this information will be merged with existing data on politics, political structures, voting by the public and political representatives, and the state of the national and local economies. the new dataset will advance knowledge of the progressive era, lifting a veil on relationships between economics and politics that existing data obscures. the data will also advance knowledge related to current policy debates, particularly the optimal design of institutions regulating financial institutions."
Collaborative Research:  Reducing Prejudice Toward Refugees:  How Social Networks Reinforce and Unravel Attitude Change,"most of the world?s political refugees live in developing countries. maintaining positive host-refugee relations is important for maintaining security in these countries. this study investigates whether face-to-face conversations aimed at taking the perspective of refugees can reduce an individual?s prejudice towards refugees in a resource-poor context, and whether changes in beliefs about and attitudes towards outgroups spread socially, via social networks after the intervention. the study results will show how social networks reinforce or undermine changes in beliefs and attitudes in the longer-term, thereby advancing knowledge on the most difficult part of this process: countering prejudice towards refugees in ways that are cost-effective and durable. additionally, the network data collected during the study will be used to build a pedagogical resource to aid social network analysis instruction. the study will culminate in both scholarly publications and a public-facing set of briefs for refugee organizations. the objectives of this study are fourfold: 1. assemble a new dataset from households with information on individual attributes, attitudes towards refugees, beliefs about community views on refugees, and rich social network information. 2. assess the effectiveness of a light-touch intervention aimed at reducing prejudice towards refugees. 3. compare the effectiveness of two possible prejudice-reduction interventions and determine how social processing reinforces or unravels attitude change in the longer-term. 4. examine which network structures correlate with other social identity markers, such as ethnic demography. randomly selected households will receive a perspective-taking treatment. in half of the households, the perspective-taking intervention will occur via a one-on-one, individual interaction, and in the others, it will occur via a social process at a community meeting. data from baseline and subsequent surveys will be analyzed to meet the study objectives. the study will be among the first to examine directly the social processing of an individual-level treatment aimed at prejudice reduction. the findings will significantly advance basic research in areas related to the study of refugee populations, prejudice regulation, and the influence of social networks on individual attitudes."
Collaborative Research: Prescribed Burning Decisions and Risk-Risk Tradeoffs,"wildfires and their environmental and social impacts are growing in the us and around the world. prescribed (rx) burning can be an effective management technique to reduce vegetation and reduce the risk of catastrophic wildfires. despite its potential benefits, the annual extent of rx burning has stayed the same or decreased across much of the country in recent years. this is due in part to the fact that rx burning entails its own risks, including smoke exposure and the possibility of a planned fire escaping control. making rx burning decisions requires making informed tradeoffs between these risks and the risks associated with uncontrolled wildfires. to inform these decisions, this project assesses two key questions. first, how do decisions by those who implement rx burning and by residents in nearby communities shape potential rx burning impacts? to answer this question, the research team takes measurements near a large number of rx burn sites over time, capturing information such as how much smoke residents near rx burns are exposed to and whether experience with rx burning influences support for this management approach. second, how do perceived risk-risk tradeoffs influence support for expanded rx burning to mitigate wildfire risk among wildland-urban interface (wui) and non-wui residents? to answer this question, the researchers survey residents in wui and non-wui areas to understand risk perceptions and policy support. understanding these tradeoffs is critical to shaping risk management policy. prescribed (rx) burning entails carefully planned fires lit under controlled conditions to manage fuels that can spur catastrophic fires and wui community disasters. the us national cohesive wildland management strategy identifies rx burning as a cost-effective solution, but its use has remained limited, particularly in the american west. managing wildfire and other climate-related hazards involves weighing risk-risk tradeoffs in order to develop effective, balanced strategies that protect communities and the environment. this interdisciplinary project uses a mixed-methods approach to advance knowledge on decision making under risk in the context of natural hazard management. the researchers develop a novel conceptual model that adapts the concept of risk-risk tradeoffs to the context of rx burning decisions. this conceptual model guides the interdisciplinary research design to address two key research questions: 1) how do decisions by implementers and residents shape rx burning impacts for wui communities in proximity to rx burn sites? to answer this question, the team generates and analyzes a first-of-its-kind dataset integrating measurements of environmental conditions, smoke emissions, built environment (housing) characteristics, air quality, exposure, health, and perceived experience measures near rx burn sites over multiple years. 2) how do perceived risk-risk tradeoffs influence support for expanded rx burning to mitigate wildfire risk among wui and non-wui residents? the team implements a large survey-based choice experiment to elicit risk-risk tradeoffs and assess rx burning support, analyzing data to understand how different risk attributes and individual characteristics shape risk perceptions and policy support. the research team is engaging with stakeholders, including policy-makers and regulators, wildfire managers and rx burn implementers, and members of the public, throughout the research process to ensure that the results are relevant and useful."
Collaborative Research: New Techniques for High-Dimensional and Incomplete Network Data,"this research project will develop new statistical and econometric resources for researchers working with social network data. social networks often play a central role in shaping the outcomes and decisions of economic agents. for example, they can predict the diffusion of a new technology or spread of a contagion, determine the influence of key agents in crime or research production, or account for treatment spillovers in many social programs. however, incorporating social network data into empirical work can be difficult. networks are fundamentally high-dimensional objects, and often it is unclear which features will be relevant for a particular social or economic phenomenon of interest. in addition, the researcher may only observe some of the relevant connections between agents in the social network for reasons of privacy or cost of data collection. this project will develop new techniques for incorporating social network structure into econometric and statistical modeling that accommodates these limitations. the project will train graduate students and develop a new course on the use of network data in causal inference. software also will be developed and disseminated. this research project will build new econometric methodology for models with high-dimensional and incomplete social network data. first, the project will develop a new nonparametric regression framework for networks, characterize its statistical properties, demonstrate its use for empirical work in the social sciences, and provide software for implementation. second, the project will investigate the informational content of partial network data generated by referral-based sampling and contingency-table data. the project will develop new theory, methodology, and empirical practices for identification, estimation, and inference using these nonstandard data types. new insights will be provided into exactly what features of social network structure are relevant for economic outcomes and decision making and when and how this information can be recovered from incomplete data in practice. the results of this research will help empiricists better understand the role that networks play in economics and the other social sciences."
Collaborative Research: Macroeconomic Implications of Economic Policy in Imperfectly Competitive Labor Markets,"this project measures the macroeconomic consequences of imperfectly competitive labor markets. in his 2022 aea presidential address, david card argued that imperfect competition in the labor market is pervasive. few firms dominate many local labor markets giving them the ability to set wages and pay workers less than their marginal product. workers are often reluctant to search for a new job, further reenforcing firms' market power. what types of policies can improve outcomes in the labor market and what are their macroeconomic effects? this project consists of a research agenda focused on this question. this project builds on a tested quantitative framework for imperfect competition in labor markets and then extends this framework to (i) account for empirical evidence from applied microeconomic studies and our own empirical contributions and then (ii) analyze policy. the frameworks developed in this project will generate several public goods. first, the frameworks allow economists, legal scholars, and policymakers to better inform minimum wage policy, merger guidelines, and optimal taxation. second, as part of this project's ongoing efforts to study the distributional consequences of mergers, this project will develop a new set of census database linkages between the decennial census, the lehd, and the lbd in order to study the effects of mergers across race, gender, occupation and other policy-relevant characteristics of workers. the codes for the models developed in this project will be available online, and the census maintains a repository of our empirical analysis for all future researchers. lastly, the models developed in this project provide a set of theoretic and computational tools that enable researchers to solve models of oligopsony quickly and efficiently. our agenda builds on our tested quantitative framework for imperfect competition in labor markets. we propose four sub-projects that apply and extend oligopsony models featuring rich worker and firm heterogeneity to: (i) understand the capacity of minimum wage policy to retrieve a portion of the efficiency losses due to wage setting power in the labor market, (ii) study the trade-offs for antitrust policy in terms of productivity improvements in output versus efficiency losses due to greater monopsony power, (iii) describe and analyze a novel link between the design of income tax policy and labor market efficiency while laying out a complete framework for analysis of distributional consequences of monopsony, (iv) revisit all three policies within a framework that allows for market power due to both `classical' monopsony via preference heterogeneity, and `frictional' monopsony due to search in a job ladder setting. in each case we either (i) provide new empirical facts to test our new theory, or (ii) hold the new theory accountable to the most up-to-date empirical evidence from the applied microeconomics literature, building a bridge between quantitative and empirical work."
Collaborative Research: Cooperation in Multi-Dyadic Civil Conflicts,"civil conflicts impose significant human, economic, and political costs on the countries involved and the broader regions affected. this is particularly true when conflicts involve multiple rebel groups (i.e., multi-dyadic conflicts). this project advances knowledge of multi-dyadic civil conflict dynamics and resolution by evaluating how government-rebel cooperation shapes opportunities for conflict resolution and violence reduction. it contributes to ongoing debates among policymakers and scholars about the dynamics of war and the nature and sustainability of post-conflict peace, speaking to fundamental questions of national security and the prosperity and welfare of countries currently embroiled in civil conflicts around the world. the project provides novel cross-country data compatible with leading civil war datasets, providing a valuable tool to advance cutting-edge research on civil conflict. moreover, the project also provides training and mentorship opportunities for undergraduate and graduate students. understanding the dynamics of cooperation between adversaries will improve evaluation and forecasting of (in)stability. the pis integrative approach to cooperation provides insights into when cooperation signals meaningful shifts in conflict dynamics and prospects for long-term peace. the project involves three central aims: (1) to create a comprehensive dataset on cooperation between combatants in multi-dyadic civil wars, (2) to assess the impact of past cooperation on future cooperation and conflict resolution, and (3) to evaluate the impact of past cooperation on future conflict. to achieve aim 1, the pis create the cooperation in civil war: multi-dyadic conflicts dataset (ccw-mc). ccw-mc covers 12 countries that have experienced the most complex civil conflicts in the post-cold war period. these novel data will capture the full evolution of dyadic cooperation from initial requests to final implementation. using these data, the pis test novel theoretical expectations (aims 2 and 3) about how the legacies of past cooperative attempts, both within a government-rebel group dyad and gleaned from observing other dyads in the country, influence subsequent cooperative and conflictual outcomes. using network analysis, the pis examine the influence of other active rebel groups on this evolution of cooperation and conflict. by engaging with the multi-dyadic context of these civil wars, the project explicitly takes each dyad's context into consideration when theorizing about and evaluating the role of cooperation. this project addresses a critical gap by examining the evolution of cooperation within and across government-rebel group dyads in multi-dyadic civil conflicts. it will provide novel insights into how cooperation diffuses across dyads, how past attempts at cooperation influence subsequent cooperative efforts, and how cooperation of one form influences subsequent cooperation of another form. the project advances research on conflict management and settlement by treating cooperation as an iterative process that reveals unique information about combatant credibility that cannot be revealed on the battlefield."
Collaborative Research: RAPID: Multinational Corporation Behavior in Time of War,"this project examines the extent to which countries can successfully wield economic (dis-)integration as a foreign policy tool. that is, when and why can countries use economic statecraft to pressure commercial firms to make investments consistent with their foreign policy interests? the project will examine the universe of foreign-owned firms in one aggressor state, and researchers will use multilingual media reports, corporate press releases, and other textual sources to document the behavior of mncs toward the aggressor state. findings from this project will provide new insights into the relative success of home countries' economic statecraft strategies against an aggressor nation under conditions of deep economic globalization. this project will also benefit both graduate and undergraduate students from diverse backgrounds through hands-on training and practical experience with data management and analysis. this project examines multinational corporation (mnc) responses to a common host country political shock, while making clear the depths of heterogeneity in mnc behavior, even and especially in light of remarkably strong economic sanctions. the theory incorporates not only host but also home country political risk, and the effects of political risk on decision-making at entry and exit, which addresses serious lacunae in the ability of the literature to explain disruptions in foreign direct investment (fdi) due to aggressive war. the project will generate a public, replicable dataset covering the universe of mncs operating in a nation-state that initiated an aggressive war. the researchers will document firm-level behavior following the invasion, based on an analysis of a multilingual corpus of media reports, corporate press releases, and related textual sources. a combined theoretical and empirical goal of this project is to identify the relevance of economic statecraft and home country political interests ? whether favoring divestment or otherwise ? to mnc decision-making under conditions of contemporary economic globalization."
Collaborative Research: Investigating the Philosophical Commitments of University Scientists across Disciplines,"this award supports a collaborative research project at the interface of philosophy of science and social studies of science. researchers in philosopher of science, sociology, and anthropology will conduct an empirical study of the philosophical commitments of scientists across a broad range of scientific disciplines. it is often thought that these commitments are shared within each scientific discipline, that they differ considerably between scientific disciplines, and that these differences pose a serious challenge to engaging in effective cross-disciplinary research. this project will be the first study of philosophical commitments to be conducted with a large representative sample of scientists across many disciplines. the study has two fundamental goals: to achieve an analytical depth of understanding of how the philosophical commitments of scientists influence their scientific practices, and to achieve a deeper understanding of the extent to which prior cross-disciplinary experiences of scientists shape their philosophical commitments. beyond enhancing the efficacy of cross-disciplinary research, this project will serve to enhance public literacy of science by providing insights for revising the tools that experts in public understanding of science use to investigate how the views of non-scientists about science or scientific thinking relate to their views on social issues. philosophical commitments refer to how scientists conceptualize the world and its scientific study, framing how scientists understand and conduct their research. these philosophical commitments have three dimensions: what methods are effective in acquiring knowledge (epistemology), what categories are fundamental (ontology), and what social values are important (axiology). the project will begin by interviewing approximately 50 scientists to determine their philosophical commitments and how they manifest in their scientific practice. the interviews will facilitate the development of survey instruments that are to be used on a much larger scale to measure the philosophical commitments of scientists. these instruments will then be used to survey a national sample of approximately 3,500 us scientists from a wide range of scientific disciplines. the survey data will then be analyzed to test the hypotheses that philosophical commitments align with scientific disciplines and that such philosophical commitments vary when scientists have had prior cross disciplinary research experience. the measurement instruments to be developed in this project will be generalizable; they can subsequently be used by others to investigate philosophical dimensions of scientific practice both within and outside of stem fields, to inform science education, and efforts to facilitate cross-disciplinary research."
Collaborative Research: Reimagining Policing by Making Neighborhoods Safe and Strong,"the project will build on and adapt the police and community engagement (pace) program to study the conditions that build safe and strong communities. through the cultivation of collaborative and sustained dialogues between the police, residents, and other community resources and stakeholders, the pace model enables collective understanding, strengthens relationships, and coordinates actions that build strong and safe places. the pis propose situational policing as a theoretical framework that shifts away from policing as law enforcement to policing as a means for creating safe places. the constructs (neighborhood atmosphere and latent psychodynamic processes) provide a way to reimagine policing with a strong-community end in mind. the situational policing framework provides officers and communities with a way to visualize and assess progress toward this desired end. the pis seek to answer the question: what keeps communities safe and strong? reimagining the police with measurable community-outcome goals?and with strategies to achieve them?has the potential to guide a larger cultural transformation in the field of policing well beyond this project. this mixed-methods study uses a participatory action research (par) approach, which is isomorphic to situational policing. par democratizes the research process by including the stakeholders (e.g., local residents, business people, police officers) as co-researchers. the sampling frame includes neighborhoods in four police districts. the pis select two neighborhoods in each district based on high risk for crime and poor police-community relationships. in each police district, one neighborhood will be identified as a control and the other for the pace treatment. pre- and post-treatment surveys will be conducted by the par teams with graduate students. the four neighborhoods identified for the pace treatment will participate in structured conversations designed to foster understanding about the challenges between and among the police and residents. the conversation will include a broad spectrum of stakeholder participants leading to informed and collaborative action. all eight neighborhoods will be surveyed at times pre and post treatment. in addition, semi-structured, open-ended focus groups will be conducted in the treatment neighborhoods by the par research team. the goal of both the quantitative and qualitative components of the study is to reveal latent psychodynamic processes that create a neighborhood atmosphere. the study measures the effect of the neighborhood atmosphere on crime, violence, drug abuse, and other social problems and the impact of pace in a reimagined policing with a safe, strong community focus."
Collaborative Research: Unintended Consequences of Law Enforcement Disruptions to Illicit Drug Networks,"the use of illicit substances remains an ongoing and widespread part of society, with the illegal drug market estimated to be one percent of total global trade. although the true scale of this market is unknown because of its illicit, underground nature, the overarching us drug policy and strategy has consistently been to allocate large amounts of resources to law enforcement agencies to dismantle illicit distribution networks. the motivation for narcotics enforcement is that it imposes negative consequences on the supply side that both deter people from distributing illicit drugs and decrease the drugs? availability to vulnerable consumers. yet little evidence suggests the negative consequences disrupt the macro-level drug supply to an extent that alters the price of drugs, and very little is known about the meso level effects of these interdictions on violence in the broader community and drug consumers at risk of fatal overdose. therefore, the purpose of this disrupting operations of illicit supply networks (d-isn) project is to utilize national integrated data to develop an understanding of the impact of law enforcement disruptions to the illicit drug supply on both public health (e.g., overdoses) and public safety (e.g., violent crime) outcomes. in order to understand the relationship between drug market disruptions and outcomes of interest, the study team will construct a county level dataset across 10 diverse states using three sources of administrative data: (1) national incident-based reporting system (nibrs), (2) national center for health statistics (nchs) detailed multiple cause of death (mcod) data, and (3) the us census. nibrs captures characteristics of crime incidents, including detailed information on drug seizures, crime offenses, and other incident characteristics in a nationally systematic way. the mcod data will provide unsuppressed, county-level, mortality information based on death certificates and include information on cause, decedent demographics, month of death, and county urbanicity. data from the census will be used to calculate rates of drug seizures and control for county level population characteristics and resource deprivation. the county-level integrated dataset will include the date of overdoses (by type of drug), public safety events (e.g., murder/nonnegligent manslaughter, robbery, and aggravated assault), and the county where the outcomes occurred. the study team will employ methods of spatial temporal causal modeling, which allows for the modeling of causal relationships between time- and space-persistent features. lastly, the integrated datasets will be shared with researchers interested in utilizing these data with information on the data integration process, how to access the data, and how to customize it to fit the needs of their research. the team will also engage with relevant stakeholders to identify or create strategies that may mitigate the unintended consequences of drug market disruptions (e.g., reduce overdoses and community violence), reduce disparities in these outcomes in communities of color, inform local and state law enforcement drug interdiction strategies, and inform the allocation of resources for drug interdiction."
Collaborative Research: Individual and Team Behavior in Indefinitely Repeated Games,"this award funds research using lab experiments to test economic theories about how decision makers interact when the end date of the interactions is uncertain. general motors competing with ford and chrysler is an example of an indefinitely repeated game. ?game? is the technical term in the economics literature for these repeated interactions. this research studies behavior of both individuals and teams of individuals. most research in this area - theoretical, empirical, and experimental - studies individuals. however, interactions outside the laboratory often involve groups of individuals in a team. past research shows that economic behavior of individuals can be quite different from the economic behavior of teams. for example, individuals generally follow through on promises to cooperate in short term economic interactions, improving economic welfare. however, teams often act in a self-beneficial manner, necessitating legal penalties to improve welfare. this project will help us understand the differences between teams and individuals in repeated economic interactions. the research method will allow teams to coordinate their actions through written or verbal communication. the research team will analyze these communications as well as actions chose during the experiment. analyzing communications will provide new insights into what motivates behavior and can identify elements of behavior that had not previously been considered. the results of the project will help managers, policymakers, and citizens understand the effects of working in teams rather than as individuals. there are a number of particular goals for the new research. game theorists distinguish between perfect and imperfect monitoring. with perfect monitoring, agents can tell what others have done with certainty, but with imperfect monitoring, they are not certain what others have done. the investigators will compare teams with individuals in indefinitely repeated prisoner dilemma (irpd) games with imperfect monitoring. they are particularly interested in contrasting the effects of team play between perfect and imperfect monitoring, and using the team discussions to help understand how they think about changes in their opponent?s action given that they cannot distinguish between a deliberate choice and random noise, which is inherent in a number of economic interactions. a second project will compare play in irpd games where continuation probabilities vary across stage games to the standard case with fixed expected end to the interactions. it is clear that discount rates vary over time outside the lab, changing the dynamic incentives agents face. will subjects account for the change in dynamic incentives and will these changes go beyond what can be explained by the changing dynamic incentives? previous results suggest that cooperation may emerge for continuation probabilities that normally produce little cooperation. a third project will explore the use of machine learning algorithms to gain greater insights into behavior from the team discussions. there is a growing literature on modern text analysis that may add substantially to what we learn from the team discussions. a fourth project will compare outcomes between individuals and teams in public good games with both monetary punishment and sanctioning of others choices (nonmonetary punishment). the goal here is to determine whether differences between teams and individuals observed in similar settings extend to public good provision for both monetary and non-monetary punishment."
Collaborative Research: Building a Framework for the Causes of and Solutions to the Pluralistic Ignorance Gap on Climate Change,"when faced with large, complex societal problems, people rely on information about others? beliefs and behaviors to decide whether and how to act. adaptive social learning, however, only works when people accurately sense others? thoughts and actions. unfortunately, mounting evidence shows large, systematic and persistent errors in perceptions about the beliefs and actions of others. in particular, people most dramatically underestimate others? climate concerns and willingness to act. these underestimates can stifle civic engagement, productive dialogue, policy support, and collective action by the general public, and discourage responses from elected officials, who respond to what they see as their constituents? priorities. this research develops a framework to better understand why people have mispreceptions and what methods can improve the accuracy of perceptions. closing this gap can encourage public and private actors to take steps towards addressing climate change. furthermore, understanding the causes of persistent social misperceptions is relevant for a broad range of problems. by studying a fundamental cognitive challenge for collective action, this research contributes to scholarship on opinion formation and supports the development of communication strategies that take into account humankind?s social nature to more effectively mobilize climate action. addressing collective action problems such as climate change requires individuals to engage in a host of coordinated behaviors to effect widespread systemic changes. recent work suggests that individuals are more likely to take action when they believe that others share their concerns and desire for action. yet, while most people are concerned about climate change, they systematically underestimate others? concern, which can inhibit action toward addressing collective challenges. drawing on interdisciplinary research, this project uses cross-sectional, longitudinal, and experimental designs across multiple samples to develop and test an integrative framework illuminating drivers of pervasive social misperceptions and pathways for correcting these biases. the proposed studies progress in three phases: 1) identifying and testing plausible explanations for social misperceptions; 2) developing and comparing methods for correcting misperceptions; and 3) testing interventions in high-impact and ecologically valid contexts, including with a sample of decision makers. the proposed research will advance the literatures in cognitive science, judgment and decision making, social psychology, and communications related to persistent and systematic misperceptions about collective norms. the research extends previous work by identifying and testing mechanisms by which misperceptions develop and persist and how they can be ameliorated, helping policymakers and educators tailor messages accordingly."
Collaborative Research: New Informationally Robust Approaches to Mechanism Design and Games of Incomplete Information,"this project develops new tools for robust predictions in strategic games where the outcome depends on some unobserved state of nature (although the players do not observe the realized state, they may receive signals allowing to update the likelihood of each possible state). these games are a fundamental tool in economic theory for understanding behavior in a wide range of settings, such as oligopoly, auctions, electoral competition, and bank runs. the classical approach is to study behavior under a fixed model of player?s information. in many practical settings, however, an analyst or policy maker may be concerned about misspecification of the players' information. the tools that we develop give predictions about the players' behavior and policy recommendations about market design, without relying on a full specification of the informational environment. the project has three components. first, we develop a new solution concept that characterizes rationalizable behavior under common prior beliefs about payoff relevant states. this is a generalization of the solution concept known as bayes? correlated equilibrium (bce), replacing the usual nash equilibrium with a weaker notion of interim correlated rationalizability. this is important, because in many settings (such as spectrum auctions which occur infrequently), strategic agents may not have had sufficient time or experience to converge on a nash equilibrium; nevertheless, we can make non-trivial predictions about behavior based on the premise that actions are rational under some (not necessarily correct) beliefs. second, we study a distinct generalization of bce in which there is an upper bound on players? information. this complements the lower bounds on information found in the existing formulations of bce; and it allows us to obtain more realistic predictions in settings where agents do not have access to all payoff-relevant information (such as bank runs or auctions of ""toxic"" assets). third, we extend and apply the burgeoning theory of informationally-robust optimal mechanisms to the problem of designing efficient trading mechanisms. existing models of bilateral trade are primarily focused on the simple and stylized case where buyer and seller each know their respective values, and those values are statistically independent. using the informationally-robust approach, we derive new trading mechanisms that are guaranteed to produce non-trivial gains from trade even when buyer and seller values are interdependent and information is correlated. the insights we develop about robust trading platforms could be utilized to improve efficiency in a wide variety of markets with informational frictions, such as the markets for financial securities or health insurance."
"Collaborative Research: Learning, Behavior, and Design in Diffusion Processes","this award funds research that uses economic theory and laboratory experiments to study information and learning on social media platforms. social media are an increasingly important source of news for many people. the content that users see on such platforms depends on what other users choose to post and share. it also depends on the algorithms that the platform developers use to generate news feeds. the researchers will investigate how the decisions of the users and developers of social media platforms affect what people learn. what types of content are users likely to see? how do people process this content to form beliefs about the relevant issues? when are these beliefs likely to be accurate? the research relates to recent debates about whether certain user and developer choices contribute to the spread of misleading or incorrect information on social media. for example, does a social media news feed that focuses on showing the most popular content (as opposed to random content) help or hurt the accuracy of people's beliefs in the long run? in the first part of the project, the researchers will develop a theoretical model describing social learning in settings where people learn by posting, sharing, and re-sharing copies of ?signals? (e.g., news stories) about the state of the world. the model will focus on how people's beliefs and behavior co-evolve when the information diffusion process driven by people's actions also influences their learning. this research will yield results about how the platform's signal-sampling algorithm, which determines which signals get shown to users, affects the accuracy of social learning and the extent of agreement in people's beliefs. the second part of the project will test these predictions in a laboratory experiment. the investigators will conduct social-learning games where subjects see predecessors' signals and choose to endorse a subset of those signals. in choosing which past signals to show to future users, different treatments will vary the weight put by the algorithm on endorsements by previous users. the third part of the project will deal with the ?tipping point? in complex diffusion models. this part of the research will identify simple conditions on individual behavior that determine whether there exists a ?tipping point? where the diffusion discontinuously switches from (a) reaching a very small fraction of the population to (b) reaching a large fraction of the population. the authors will investigate whether such transitions always happen smoothly."
Collaborative Research: RAPID: A Novel Framework & Toolkit to Measure Protest Legacies in Non-democratic States,"large-scale protests are missed opportunities to improve our understanding of why some cases of mobilization lead to renewed protest and unexpected regime challenges and other cases it builds regime support. to understand these different outcomes, this project shifts focus to protest legacies: their sustained effects on regime legitimation strategies, societal capacity to resist, and future regime development. to date, little research has been done to examine the role of state narratives and disinformation following protest and its effect on public opinion. this project develops a rapid response toolkit to study protest legacies in authoritarian states, highlighting the role of information politics. protest spread as grievances evolved to include political frustration and, in some places, peaceful protest gave way to riots. initially the regime offered policy concessions, but when protest continued, the state turned to repression. the project uses toolkit measures to track top-down strategies to restore order and citizens' reactions to regime efforts to restore order. this new approach to studying legacies will provide a basis for understanding the emergence of new protest cycles and continued regime instability. this project breaks new ground on the study of large-scale protest by moving beyond the question of whether protests result in regime change to analyzing the viability of state strategies in response to mass mobilization. it uses a three-person leader-follower signaling game, which enables the testing of propositions from two broad approaches in the existing literature: (1) the state-centric approach, which draws from the literature on authoritarian state capacity and characterizes protest as a crisis that the state must address to reestablish control, and (2) the protest accumulation model, drawn from social movement studies. autocratic states can react to protest by attempting to bolster their legitimacy through institutional reform, policy change and by constructing and reconstructing narratives about the protest events and the state's response to these events. individuals react by accepting or rejecting state narratives to different degrees, affecting future societal protest capacity. the pis' leader-follower game predicts those responses. utilizing recent mass mobilizations, the project develops a rapid response toolkit to enable scholars to study protest legacies in authoritarian states, highlighting the role of information politics. the toolkit travel across protest contexts to build a comparative data set of protest legacies, defined as: state narratives about events, state policy change to respond to protest, and social attitudes and capacity for renewed protest. as mass mobilization in non-democratic countries becomes more common, an understanding of legacies is critical to predict regime durability, market disruptions, and future conflict."
"Collaborative Research: Adolescent Development, Legal Comprehension, and Decision-Making Among Justice-Involved Youth","reforming the juvenile justice system along developmental principles is an urgent priority for many states and local jurisdictions. over 700,000 adolescents have contact with the juvenile justice system every year, with a majority referred to community supervision via juvenile probation. adolescents on probation encounter systems of rules, obligations, and conditions that place them in daily jeopardy of non-compliance and failure. youth who are non-compliant are more likely to have continued involvement in the juvenile justice system, institutional placement, and chronic involvement with the criminal justice system as adults. there is emerging evidence to suggest that non-compliance rates are higher when adolescents have an incomplete understanding of the rules and conditions imposed on them. the current study has two aims. the first is to explore, more fully, the relationship between comprehension and compliance and whether it differs based on individual perceptions and experiences. the second is to test whether comprehension can be enhanced and whether improved comprehension improves outcomes with regards to court orders and probation conditions. this study examines the developmental conditions under which adolescent understanding of the rules and conditions of their probation orders is associated with short-term and long-term positive and negative probation outcomes. it does this through an experimental test of the ?condition comprehension interview? in a sample of adolescents on probation (n = 200). the interview was adapted from teach-back interventions in medicine and nursing to strengthen treatment adherence. it aims to strengthen three aspects of adolescent understanding that are expected to influence adolescent behavioral outcomes: the specificity of their knowledge about probation rules and conditions, reasoning about rewards and consequences for compliance and non-compliance, and appreciation for the relevance of their rules and conditions for their long-term goals and ambitions. the research will test the hypothesis that adolescent comprehension of their probation rules and conditions in these three dimensions will make legal decisions in their day-to-day lives that are aligned with their rules and conditions. along with the direct effects of condition comprehension, the study will explore the roles of three dimensions of adolescent development that are hypothesized to influence the salience of their understanding on probation outcomes: legal socialization and legal cynicism, socio-emotional development, and identity development. outcomes of the study include 3-month and 12-month legal outcomes reported in probation case files, parental report of adolescent behavioral outcomes during the first three months of their probation term, and adolescent daily self-report of their compliance and rule following conducted within the first 3 months of their probation term. overall, this study will provide practical guidance and strategies to juvenile justice agencies to strengthen adolescent behavioral outcomes, will help these agencies tune their approaches according to the developmental needs of adolescents they serve, and extend theories of legal comprehension and legal decision making to the field of juvenile justice with a particular emphasis on the post-adjudication phase of justice processing."
"Collaborative Research: Patterns, Context, and Secondary Impacts of State Policy Responses to the Pandemic","understanding the role of policy developments in the response to the covid-19 pandemic is vital for researchers, lawmakers, and the public to improve preparedness for future public health emergencies. this opportunity to learn from an ongoing pandemic and inform choices in the future requires extensive and timely data gathering. u.s. state governments have taken tens of thousands of public policy actions?executive orders, regulations, and laws in response to covid-19. this project advances our understanding of the causes and consequences of states' policy responses to the pandemic. the pis collect data on state governments' decisions to mitigate covid-19's impact, analyze the adoption and diffusion of pandemic-related policies, track state officials' online discussion of the pandemic, and study health impacts of policies implemented in response to it. this project provides insights into how states manage a global health crisis, the ways that online communication and policy debate involving public officials factor into the contemporary management of a public health emergency, and the public health impacts of rapid innovations in state health policies. it provides comprehensive data sources on state policy activities as well as online communication by state officials. these data are helpful to others who seek to understand the causes and consequences of states' pandemic policies. the project also involves hiring and training a diverse, multidisciplinary team of graduate and undergraduate research assistants as well as a post-doc. the project leaders will provide extensive training, experience, and mentorship to these early career researchers. state policy responses to the covid-19 pandemic have occurred rapidly, with information and choices updated daily. this timeframe provides an opportunity to study the rapid spread of policy responses?two orders of magnitude more frequent than the typical yearly timescale covered in policy diffusion research. the data collected in this study cover hundreds of pandemic-related policies and tens of thousands of policy actions by states, all unfolding over a three-year time period. the decision environment in which governments select their responses to covid-19 involves several key components that have been found to be important in the study of the spread of public policy: information, imitation, competition, and coercion. thus, the covid-19 pandemic represents a rare opportunity to study the spread of public policy with voluminous contemporary information about the factors that influence states' decisions. specifically, this project uses the recent timeline and high salience of covid-19 policy to understand the relationship between online communication involving policymakers and official policymaking activity. because most elected state officials are active online, particularly on twitter, policy responses to covid-19 present the opportunity to understand the relationship between online communication by officials and public policymaking. lastly, to illustrate the utility of the data collected, this project uses a difference-in-differences approach to study the covid-19 policies? secondary impacts on health. given that covid-19 policy responses have affected every facet of public and private life, this project includes a focused study of the impacts of pandemic policy responses on maternal and infant health in the american states."
Collaborative Research: RAPID: Resilience and Recovery among Ukrainian Small Business Owners,"this project will enhance of our understanding of how entrepreneurs cope with crisis and loss as well as how various resilience factors can facilitate recovery and rebuilding in communities disrupted by war or other disasters. knowledge from this project will significantly inform the development of future support for entrepreneurs who experience trauma. the project will assess and track the well-being and coping processes of ukrainian small business owners displaced by war. specifically, it will assess personality and social factors associated with resilience as well as the nature of the trauma and loss they experienced. participants will be tracked over the course of a year and assessed on their current well-being, coping strategies, and future plans."
Collaborative Research: Understanding the Evolution of Political Campaign Advertisements over the Last Century,"television advertising, a primary way voters hear about candidates absent a media filter, is ubiquitous with political campaigns in the united states. drawing on an existing but underutilized data set of over 100,000 political ads, this project examines the evolution of political advertising, especially as it pertains to issue advocacy and consonance. the project makes significant methodological and substantive contributions to several fields including political, information, and library sciences, and enhances our understanding of the way ads shape and inform political behavior. it also promotes interdisciplinary graduate and undergraduate education at research and teaching institutions in the emerging sub-field of automated audiovisual analysis, including students and scholars from traditionally underrepresented groups. the project uses a collection of over 100,000 political ads from 1912-2018, the julian p. kanter political commercial collection archived at the university of oklahoma, to develop (1) an automated system to identify issue (and other politically relevant) content from ad image, audio, and text and (2) a state-of-the-art user interface that gives researchers the ability to query, interact with and view videos, and also output data for analysis. the project uses the data to examine the evolution of political advertising, testing models of horizontal and vertical diffusion of issues. the project?s tools and data, introduced at an interdisciplinary workshop, are widely available to scholars across a number of disciplines who study american politics, campaigns, political communication and public opinion. this collaborative project is jointly funded by the accountable institutions and behavior (aib) program and the established program to stimulate competitive research (epscor)."
Collaborative Research: Integrating Interdisciplinary Approaches into Biology Textbooks,"this project brings together research from interdisciplinary fields to create a novel approach to biology and biology education. this project draws from theoretical work across the humanities and even outside of the academy to change the way we think about knowledge about our living worlds. currently biology education continues to rely on memorization of biological facts. those facts are often simplified and narrowly developed in one discipline. by integrating knowledge from current science and technology literature into biology curriculum, undergraduate students will learn additional skills for engaging in science and research throughout their lives. the developed curriculum aims to shift how all people think about their competence and ethical responsibility to understand and fully participate in science. this study therefore has the potential to impact who becomes interested and invested in biology by using participatory ways of learning. this pedagogical intervention will contribute to the benefits of science to be more evenly distributed throughout society. the project outcomes will be of interest to policy makers, educators, parents and students. the project is broken into three parts. the first part provides the basis and rationale for the project by analyzing current biology textbooks identifying points for intervention. part two of the project culls research on the subject matter of biology, bodies and environments, from interdisciplinary academic and non-academic sources that are typically underrepresented in biology education. the final part of the project integrates these knowledges into education modules to be tested in classes and public forums. to realize its potential and allow for future expansion to k-12 and larger segments of the public, the results will be made broadly accessible to educators and laypersons through open access. this project may also serve as a model for how more interdisciplinary research can be successfully conducted across typical divisions between the humanities and sciences."
Collaborative Research: Digital Archives and Indigenous Afterlives of Scientific Objects,"at a moment when universities, museums, and archives are grappling with questions of how to responsibly manage and care for scientific collections created under unequal power dynamics, this project explores the role of digital access in understanding these histories, redressing associated harms, and envisioning new and more equitable forms of research for groups that have been marginalized. through the collaborative construction of a digital archive, this project responds to requests from indigenous communities for the return of scientific materials such as photographs, audio recordings, and publications that document their lives and communities. it explores the potential of digital infrastructures to enable communities? control of materials that document them, according to their norms for sharing and protecting knowledge. analysis of the ways participants experience and see themselves in relation to scientific research will help future researchers better respond to subjects? and communities? priorities. this project will provide resources, training, and a model for undergraduate and graduate students to pursue research in the social and natural sciences. it will contribute to broader initiatives that engage scientists, data repositories, and archival materials to democratize access and engagement in scholarly work while maintaining respect for indigenous and local knowledge systems. drawing on methodological insights from indigenous studies that prioritize reciprocal foundations of knowledge, this project will develop a methodology to effectively examine asymmetries in knowledge production, helping scholars learn how to incorporate reciprocity and care into their work. using data collected through community consultation, semi-structured interviews, and ethnography of the construction and use of the digital archive, this research will offer theoretical insights into: (1) the potentials and pitfalls of re-using already-collected materials; (2) how approaches to archives and collections that reconfigure power dynamics and permit community-based reinterpretation can result in new knowledge about history and science; (3) how digital returns of scientific materials can contribute to community-defined research and inform human sciences research with indigenous communities more broadly. in addition to science and technology studies scholars and historians of science, this project will be of interest to librarians, archivists, museum professionals, and others dedicated to privacy and justice in the collection and use of human data. findings will inform research design across a wide range of fields in the humanities, social sciences, and natural sciences, as well as policy and practice related to human subject?s research regulation."
Collaborative Research: Extended Family Support and the Housing Stability of Youth,"family rejection is a well-known cause of youth homelessness. this project aims to understand how support from extended family members shapes pathways of housing stability and safety before youth end up at shelters or on the streets. the study documents the roles and practices of grandparents, aunts, uncles, cousins, and adult siblings in providing long-term shelter and housing stability for youth whose parents are unsupportive or ambivalent about their children?s identities and behaviors. the research is innovative in its focus on youth who are experiencing challenges at home but are not yet homeless. the study advances the science on familial social support and homelessness. researchers draw from the study?s findings to engage in outreach to youth shelters and programs and inform practitioners and decision-makers on strategies to prevent youth homelessness. to understand the role of non-parental relatives and how their support shapes the housing stability and safety of youth, this project studies 80 youth aged 16-19 who are at risk of homelessness using a 14-month mixed-methods longitudinal approach. participants are recruited from two states in the southwest united states, including youth in rural communities and from minority groups. data are collected through an initial interview, 10 monthly surveys, and a follow-up interview tailored to each respondent. researchers evaluate how the forms and consistency of instrumental and emotional support that youths receive from extended family influence their sense of safety and housing stability. a longitudinal approach enables analysis of how family support and housing stability and safety shift over time."
"Collaborative Research: Parenting, Housework, Well-being, and the COVID-19 Pandemic","the covid-19 pandemic has dramatically altered family life in the united states. this project studies how parents? engagement in domestic labor and paid work has changed throughout the pandemic and what factors may be driving these changes. it also investigates long-term consequences of the pandemic for the division of household labor between mothers and fathers, and the impacts of the pandemic on parents? well-being. starting in the first months of the pandemic and continuing for five years, this project illuminates how family and work life have changed over the course of the covid-19 pandemic. insights from this study inform decisionmakers to better meet the needs of working parents and families. this project uses longitudinal survey data from a sample of partnered u.s. parents. parents were first surveyed in april 2020 and asked about their work and household activities prior to and one month after the pandemic began. these parents were surveyed again in november 2020 and october 2021, along with a new set of respondents at each wave. follow-up surveys result in six waves of data spanning the period from march 2020 through september 2025. approximately 6,500 parents are surveyed at least once during the study. these data are used to assess (a) changes in parents? divisions of domestic labor, (b) the factors driving these changes, (c) effects on mothers? labor force participation, and (d) changes in parents? well-being and relationship quality. the novel nature of these data are uniquely situated to assess the long-term consequences of the covid-19 pandemic for parents? work and family life and their well-being."
Collaborative Research: Regulating Electricity Markets: Impacts on Energy Transitions and Environmental Justice,"while electricity generation is critical to modern economic and modern life, it also generates substantial pollution, which falls disproportionately on minority and lower income groups. the world is in the middle of two major transitions to cleaner sources of electricity generation: first from coal to natural gas and from natural gas to renewable energy. these transitions are occurring in a highly regulated environment, raising the question of how regulation affects energy transitions and for the distribution of pollution (environmental justice). this project studies the effect of rate-of-return regulation on previous energy transitions and evaluates how changes in this regulatory structure may influence ongoing transitions. in addition, this project evaluates how environmental regulatory agencies incorporate environmental justice into their clean air act amendment enforcement decisions, and how alternative enforcement decisions impact community well-being. the results of this project will provide inputs into electricity regulation policies in order to hasten the transition to clean energy as well as improve environmental justice. to evaluate the role of rate-of-return regulation in energy transitions, this project develops and structurally estimates a model where utilities invest in and retire generation capacity in the long run and make usage decisions in the short run. in this model, the regulator attempts to incentivize utilities to minimize costs while meeting electricity needs by offering a fair rate-of-return on generators that are deemed ?used and useful.? further, this project estimates how environmental justice enters regulators' preferences over enforcement. the model allows regulators to incorporate both communities? and electricity generators? welfare in enforcement decisions. this project provides a framework for evaluating new approaches to regulating electricity generators? choices and the impact of these choices on local communities. the results of this project will provide inputs into electricity regulation policies in order to hasten the transition to clean energy as well as improve environmental justice."
Collaborative Research: The Value of Data,"this research will investigate the value that the data of a consumer has for the firm that uses it. in many digital platforms, consumer data is often used to intermediate the needs of various agents with conflicting interests?such as buyers and sellers, drivers and riders, or social-media users and advertisers. this makes determining the value of data especially complex. this research will tackle the complexity issue and provide a more complete account of the value of data?especially its dependence on privacy-protection policies. by doing so, it will advance our understanding of the demand for data in the digital economy and provide insights into how data markets work and may be affected by policy interventions. this research will also shed light on the debate about how to individually compensate consumers for their data, which many scholars and policymakers believe to be an essential aspect of a functioning data market. more specifically, this research project will study what determines the value of an individual consumer?s data record for the intermediary that uses it as an input in its business. for instance, such a record can be the characteristics of a buyer that an e-commerce platform stores on its servers. when data is used by a third party (like a platform) to strategically direct interactions between multiple agents (like buyers and sellers), assessing its value is complicated and calls for a new approach. the project shows that this value is not just the payoff the intermediary derives directly from a record (like a platform?s transaction fee). it involves other components, which can significantly bias our assessments if ignored. they capture externalities between the records of, say, different buyers not because of a statistical correlation, but because of how the platform partitions its knowledge of the buyers so as to direct sellers? responses (e.g., by pooling buyers into market segments). such externalities can render the record of a low-spending buyer more valuable than that of a high-spending buyer. the first part of the project will study contexts where the intermediary already owns the data and can use it without people?s consent. its core contribution is to show how to properly assess the value of individual records and characterize all its components. the second part of the project will study how the value of data changes when each consumer can withhold their data from the platform. one key insight is that privacy rights may not only shift wealth from data-users to data-sources (i.e., from intermediaries to consumers), but also change the value of data records itself. for instance, it can increase the value of some people?s records at the expense of others. thus, privacy can have redistributive effects across data-sources, which may contribute to social inequality and should be taken into account by privacy-protection policies."
Collaborative Research: Labor Market and Public Policy Preferences,"what people want (preferences) is central to economic analysis and policy formulation. yet there is no easy or generally acceptable way of measuring preferences from data. the proposed research develops a portable, scalable, and easy to measure preference revelation (elicitation) method called the bayesian adaptive choice experiment (bace). bace improves upon existing preference elicitation approaches that are used in policy analysis, regulation, and litigation. the method will be applied to study important and policy-relevant questions: (i) preferences for job amenities such as workplace flexibility, and firm provision of such amenities---important considerations in the face of global technical and organizational changes. this is important as global technical and organizational changes have the potential to alter the structure of work as the costs of providing workplace amenities shift over time. (ii) in preferences for public policies, the research produces method of comparing the welfare benefits of various policies for different demographic groups. in addition to these applications, bace shows the potential for a new generation of surveys and experimental methods to do much more in helping researchers and policymakers value non-market resources. the results of this research will contribute significantly to improve economic analyses as well as improve the quality of public policies and business decisions and thus increase economic growth. bace provides an efficient dynamic elicitation procedure for conducting choice experiments. it does so by generating the information-maximizing sequence of choice scenarios based on a prior that gets updated with previous answers to obtain individual-level bayesian posterior estimates. the procedure allows for a higher precision of the parameter estimates with fewer choice scenarios presented to each subject while also overcoming systematic biases in estimating average preference parameters from commonly used static approaches. applying the method to preferences for job amenities, the resulting individual-level preference data makes it possible to estimate a new model of compensating differentials that extends the classic rosen (1986) framework. applying bace to willingness to pay for public policies produces new evidence on the correlates of policy preferences and leads to novel estimates of the marginal value of public funds. the implementation of bace in this research is a step forward in allowing such procedures to be widely adopted to measure important inputs for understanding a broad range of phenomena in social sciences. the results of this research will contribute significantly to improve economic analyses as well as improve the quality of public policies and business decisions and thus increase economic growth."
Collaborative Research: Explaining Differential Success in Biodiversity Knowledge Commons,"scientists increasingly rely on community-governed digital portals to store and access open data. while these digital portals have improved access to data and other scientific products, portals are expensive to implement, challenging to maintain, and often fail to have uptake among key stakeholders. like those working in other areas of the digital economy, scientists have increasingly adopted platforms to implement and tailor portals to particular communities and needs, a model that lowers infrastructure costs and enables benefits of scale across networked portals. yet portals built from the same platform nonetheless show a large variation in their outcomes. participation in any particular portal is often short-lived and the impacts of data portals on the scientific process are challenging to evaluate; portal usage typically fails to map onto traditional measures of research productivity such as publications and citation counts. this project is the first to systematically investigate scientific data portals built from a common platform in order to understand portal communities and outcomes. the research design, which compares biodiversity data portals, will inform studies of other platforms and digital knowledge commons, such as open source software and peer-production communities. specific findings and recommendations will be shared with biodiversity portal stakeholders regarding the effective design and use of these portals in order to improve uptake and access to these important species data and facilitate science and decision making around environmental change. this project uses fuzzy set qualitative comparative analysis (fsqca) to analyze open data portals as a kind of knowledge commons that impose minimal restrictions on access or reuse. the study sample comprises the 37 active and 4 inactive biodiversity data portals built from the symbiota platform, one of the largest and earliest scientific data platforms still under continual development, with hundreds of participating biodiversity collections and several dozen individually managed portals. in 2020, symbiota portals collectively provided access to over 60 million biodiversity data records and accounted for 90% of web traffic accessing specimens digitized through the nsf?s advanced digitization of biodiversity collections (adbc) program, which has invested over $50 million in this area to date. the project synthesizes across multiple types and sources of quantitative and qualitative data to identify why some of these portals achieve sustained growth and others do not. to do so, the project collects and analyzes up to ten years of analytics and other information from the portals, including tracked usage data, community building activities, features of portal governance, and resource inputs, as well as observation data collected during portal site visits and interviews with a stratified sample of portal managers. the fsqca approach enables comparative inferences about those portal features most likely to foster productive and sustained outcomes, including collective benefit and building inclusive scientific communities."
FW-HTF-R: Collaborative Research: Partnering Workers with Interactive Robot Assistants to Usher Transformation in Future Construction Work,"construction is a $10 trillion industry that employs about 180 million workers worldwide. however, the future of construction work is at crossroads. first, productivity in construction work has been stagnant relative to other industries (e.g., manufacturing), and the industry has historically been slow to adopt innovations that affect efficiency. second, it has been difficult to offset the aging and retiring workforce with younger and more diverse workers, causing the workforce supply to fall short of rising demand. this is mainly because construction work tends to be physically strenuous leading to occupational hazards that often force workers to retire early. robotization has been suggested as a potential solution to these problems. however, the unstructured nature of construction work presents several technical, social and economic impediments that hinder the direct adoption and integration of such innovations by the construction industry. for construction workers, robotic technology can only be transformative if it allows them to channel their passion for the work while avoiding the chronic pain and health outcomes associated with its physical demands. this project investigates if construction work can be conceived as a human-robot partnership, where human workers play the critical role of planning the work, and training and supervising robotic assistants to adapt to presented workspace conditions and perform useful work. the project team is integrating advances in interactive task learning, mixed reality, and reinforcement learning to enable construction workers to naturally collaborate with robot assistants through direct physical interaction and virtual supervision and training. for such a symbiotic human-robot partnership to benefit construction workers and result in widespread deployment, workers need to be equipped with new skills. the project team is exploring new educational and professional development programs to support worker aspirations for upskilling and lifelong learning, and to open avenues for people of diverse abilities to be productive members of the construction workforce. tight-knit partnerships with industry collaborators will inform the project activities and provide access to construction work sites and training facilities for testing and evaluation."

FW-HTF-R:  Collaborative Research: Virtual Meeting Support for Enhanced Well-Being and Equity for Game Developers,"the covid-19 pandemic ushered in a new era of remote work, highlighting barriers to well-being, equity, and inclusion. virtual meeting fatigue, the exhaustion that occurs after long periods of videoconferencing, has been identified as especially harmful to women and people of color, compounding common face-to-face inequities like unequal talking time and interruptions in meetings. to develop more inclusive and equitable remote workspaces, this research asks: how can future virtual meeting platforms better support well-being and social equity? to address this question, the project focuses on a uniquely appropriate group: video game developers, who rely heavily on virtual meetings within teams with varied expertise (i.e., design, programming, and art), represent an estimated $160 billion industry (over $40 billion domestic), and grapple with issues of social equity in the workplace. the interdisciplinary research is using insights from these workers to identify general best practices for virtual meetings among diverse teams to minimize fatigue and improve well-being, equity, and inclusion. the project uses a mixed-methodological approach to pinpoint and test virtual meeting-platform features that influence user welfare. study 1 utilizes natural language processing of social media to develop a broad, inductive understanding of how virtual meeting elements relate to well-being and social equity. study 2 utilizes a survey of remote workers in an exploratory analysis of how virtual meeting features statistically relate to user welfare. study 3 uses targeted interviews to qualitatively interpret broader insights about virtual meetings within the context of video game developers. study 4 uses an online experiment to test hypotheses about which specific virtual meeting features enhance video game-developer welfare. study 5 prototypes and user tests a virtual reality meeting platform with game development teams to confirm which design features promote well-being and social equity. a public ?guide to virtual meetings for well-being and equity? is being developed based on insights from these studies."
FW-HTF-P: Collaborative Research: Artificial Intelligence-Supported Development of Future Organizational Leaders,"the purpose of the proposed effort is to aid future leadership development professionals (ldp) in their work to train a diverse pipeline of leaders. the future of work involves a virtual context for many occupations. hence, two new challenges for ldp workers are to train leaders to perform effectively in a virtual context and to leverage future technology in their training of leaders. we address these challenges by proposing to create a leadership training platform to be used by ldp workers to train the next generation of diverse leaders to adapt to an online setting. the proposed platform leverages artificial intelligence (ai) models to provide real-time feedback to leaders. an interactive dashboard including visualization and storytelling will be developed as the front-end to provide information on leaders? performance to improve their leadership signals. the proposed work will have practical implications for numerous stakeholders. first, ldp will be able to effectively train current and emerging leaders to work in the virtual setting. second, future leaders and their followers will benefit from the improved training. third, the approach aims to substantially reduce discrimination in leadership evaluations by creating objective and diverse training data. the current scope of work within the award is focused on creating partnerships and further developing the proposed work. the award will support on-site and virtual meetings and observations of end users of the proposed ai platform (i.e., ldps). a leadership and data science workshop will be held to share and develop ideas. ldps will participate for training and networking purposes and to provide feedback. a consultant will be engaged to develop the project plan. graduate students will assist in additional analytic model building and the creation of study materials for the project and subsequent data collections (e.g., developing the experimental protocol; creating recruitment and training materials)."
Collaborative Research: Urban Flooding and Residential Adaptation,"of all natural hazards, flooding exerts the greatest economic and social impacts on the us population, and its impacts have increased over time. in response, the us government is funding the voluntary acquisition of homes in floodplains across the country, removing people and homes from the nation?s most flood-prone areas. this project advances scientific understanding of managed retreat from american floodplains, including their impacts on different types of communities. results provide decisionmakers, floodplain managers, and community leaders with state-of-the-art knowledge needed to make flood adaption more socially and administratively successful in the future. this project investigates tens of thousands of households nationwide who have exited, stayed, and entered neighborhoods targeted by the federal government?s policy of managed retreat. the project leverages novel sources of data to follow the residential trajectories of participants and non-participants to and from neighborhoods targeted for managed retreat over time. sources will include individual-level data on residential histories, address-level data on future flood risks, and longitudinal household survey and interview data. the study also accounts for the different types of communities in which households are embedded. results contribute to understanding of residential mobility as a form of flood adaptation and how managed retreat unfolds differently for different populations facing increasing flood risks."
HNDS-R Collaborative Research: Measuring Belief Distortions to Improve Predictive Outcomes,"systematic expectational errors embedded in beliefs (belief distortions) can have important effects on the economy. this project aims to explore the relation between belief distortions and economic outcomes. the research will explore to what extent beliefs pertaining to key variables closely related to monetary policy, such as interest rates and financial aggregates, may be distorted. the project will also examine how the beliefs and sentiments voiced in polling, such as those pertaining to elections, may produce biased forecasts of election outcomes. in exploring these questions, the project will utilize textual data from written documents such as online news outlets and social media, and data from betting markets, which will further be combined with other economic indicators. by utilizing this data, the project will account for biases in surveyed expectations about the future path of monetary policy as well as the performance of polls and surveys in predicting financial market variables and election outcomes. the project will develop machine learning based methods to improve prediction and estimation in a range of settings that rely on surveys by uncovering systematic errors in survey responses, and by correcting these errors using artificial intelligence algorithms. these tools will provide considerable potential improvements in prediction accuracy of surveys in a variety of contexts in the economy. a fundamental challenge in addressing whether beliefs are biased is that no objective measure of such distortions exists. this research aims to address this challenge by leveraging advancements in machine learning. a general premise of the approach followed in this project is that big data algorithms can be productively employed to reveal subjective biases in human judgements in multiple contexts, thereby facilitating more accurate objective forecasts. the project will construct and study a comprehensive, methodologically consistent, econometric measure of belief distortions in expectations about future monetary policy and electoral outcomes, among other variables. this objective requires employment of large amounts of data related to real-time decision making and machine-learning tools to reduce sampling noise. data scraped from written documents will be analyzed using a latent dirichlet allocation type of model to extract high-frequency measures of the topics covered by news outlets and social media. data about election outcomes, betting markets, and financial market futures contracts will be added to a large real time dataset of economic information. the research will then incorporate these methodologies and data to study beliefs and possible judgmental errors found in survey expectations related to the future conduct of monetary policy, the behavior of financial markets, and the outcomes of elections. the inclusion of fast-moving variables taken from options and futures markets and scraped from online documents will enable high-frequency tracking of revisions in beliefs and objective forecasts. this framework will allow high-frequency revisions in beliefs to be connected to specific news and announcements to improve prediction accuracy."
Collaborative Research: RUI: Collaborative Research and Education Architecture for Transformative Engagement with STS (CREATE/STS),"the aim of this project is to test innovative methods for integrating stem and humanities curricula in a 4-year college setting. with pervasive and increasingly complex ethical and social issues related to emerging science and technology, undergraduate students in both stem and humanities fields need better interdisciplinary preparation to address these societal challenges in their professional careers. while general education requirements may ensure breadth, there remains little integration of stem and humanities perspectives. the field of science and technology studies (sts) is uniquely positioned to facilitate such integration through sts pedagogies?interdisciplinary practices of teaching and learning that build on the field?s deep engagement with the ethical and societal dimensions of science, technology, and innovation. this project implements and evaluates a model for collaboratively developing sts pedagogies with a cohort of stem and humanities faculty and undergraduate students, designed to build new interdisciplinary sts modules for each participating faculty member?s course. this research has the potential of refining a model that can be adopted by a variety of institutions to facilitate the dissemination and uptake of sts pedagogies across the curriculum. this project addresses three research questions: 1) can this model effectively support the integration of humanities and stem perspectives in undergraduate training? 2) can collaborative sts pedagogy development effectively cultivate new interdisciplinary collaborations between humanities and stem experts? 3) does this model contribute to the recognition and value of sts in interdisciplinary undergraduate training within four-year degree programs? through four year-long implementations of the model across four different institutions?james madison university, colorado school of mines, michigan state university, and university of maryland college park?this research will evaluate and refine the model, attending to institutional, disciplinary, and other factors that impact its implementation and effectiveness. using ethnographic and qualitative methods for analyzing each implementation, this project will produce a rich description of the model and associated sts pedagogies, and an open access best-practices handbook for adapting this model in different institutional settings and collaboratively developing sts pedagogies with humanities and stem colleagues. additionally, as undergraduate students will be involved in the project and will support data collection and analysis, it will provide opportunities to mentor a new generation in research and evidence-based sts pedagogy."
Collaborative Research: Examining the effects of academic mobility on individual professors? research activity and institutional human capital at HBCUs,"this award is funded in whole or in part under the american rescue plan act of 2021 (public law 117-2). hbcus comprise 3 percent of higher education institutions in the united states but make substantial contributions to the preparation of black professionals. despite these achievements, hbcus, since the 1960s, often lose the battle with non-hbcus for the most talented black students and faculty, causing a ?brain drain? from hbcus. because of social mobility and civil rights movements in the past few decades, the need to investigate academic mobility of faculty at hbcus is ever-increasing. the goal of this project is to examine two forms of effects of academic mobility. the first is the effect at the institution level, measuring the potential brain drain from hbcus. the second is the effect at the individual faculty level, assesses the impact of academic moves on their career advancement. results from this large-scale, longitudinal analysis will provide important evidence regarding the career paths of professors at hbcus, including those moving to other hbcus and those moving to other types of institution. this project will identify and seek to understand factors associated with mobility and retention decisions for hbcu faculty and provide data-backed evidence to support a diverse, inclusive, and equitable scientific workforce. the project will collect faculty affiliation data from 35 hbcus with master- or doctoral-level programs. it will use internet archive as the primary data source and linkedin, orcid, and proquest as secondary data sources. the project will link large, heterogeneous corpora of faculty affiliation data, carnegie classification institution profile data, web of science publication and citation data, and survey and interview data. the linked data will be used to conduct expansive, cross-domain examinations of the impact of academic moves on individual professors? research activity and institutional human capital. the project will employ statistical modeling and historical comparisons in combination with surveys and interviews. the combination of quantitative and qualitative results will provide evidence concerning both the causes of institutional human capital change at hbcus and the effect of moves on professors? research activities. this project will contribute new knowledge on academic mobility, particularly for minority-serving institutions (msis). the project will design an interactive visual dashboard to share project outputs broadly. the visual dashboard will be updated annually in september for three additional years beyond the conclusion of the project. the results of this project will provide insights for administrators and policy makers."

Collaborative Research: Asymptotic Approximations for Sequential Decision Problems in Econometrics,"economic and social data are often collected over time. the data collection method may sometimes be adjusted to respond to lessons learnt during the data collection in earlier periods. in these situations, researchers may need to estimate policy effects, test hypotheses, or adjust experimental designs dynamically as new data become available. the estimation method will need to adjust as the data changes. there are currently no efficient methods for drawing inference from data collected in such sequential manner. this project will develop new and innovative methods for analyzing such sequential statistical problems. the project will devise methods that are easy to solve mathematically and allow researchers to properly evaluate dynamically collected data and maximize the efficiency with which the data is used to draw policy conclusions. these methods will be useful in several areas of economics, biostatistics, medicine, and other social sciences. the results of this research will improve methods of policy evaluation, hence improve the functioning of the us economy and governance. this project will develop new methods for analyzing statistical decision problem in dynamic settings. we will extend the limits of experiments framework to incorporate the informational structure in various forms of sequential data collection. the first part of the research will focus on sequential settings where the information available to the analyst is fixed or set exogenously to the collected data. the second part of the project will include settings where sequential collection of data evolves dynamically to reflect information gained from earlier portions of the data. for each of these settings, two key research outputs will be: (i) new information-adapted asymptotic representation theorems; and (ii) a new asymptotic optimality framework and findings. the results of this research will improve methods of policy evaluation, hence improve the functioning of the us economy and governance."
"Collaborative Research: The Effects of Information, Mentoring and Time on Economic Faculty at MSIs","this award is funded in whole or in part under the american rescue plan act of 2021 (public law 117-2). faculty at minority serving institutions (msis) make considerable contributions to educating and training science leaders. yet, the national science foundation (nsf) has received few proposals from msi faculty over time. this project will implement an intervention that will support msi faculty in two ways. first, msi faculty will be granted time to write and submit proposals to the nsf. second, faculty will be mentored through the proposal preparation process. the project will evaluate the impacts of the intervention by collecting and analyzing data from mentees, i.e., msi faculty participants. the intervention is expected to increase nsf proposal submissions by msi faculty, improve their proposal preparation skills, and in the long run, contribute to greater inclusion of faculty at msis in stem. undergraduate students at will support the research process by assisting with data collection and analysis. prior initiatives suggest that a proposal mentoring intervention such is likely to change behavior through several channels, e.g., information awareness and feedback, role models and networks, cognitive load theory, and metacognitive awareness. underlying these different theories of change, is a factor that seems to have been taken for granted: faculty?s time availability. this research will directly tackle time constraints by offering msi faculty mentees a course release to write proposals and address other constraints through intensive mentoring, workshops, and debriefing. findings will be derived from a mixed-methods approach that combines quantitative and qualitative data analyses (i.e., surveys and focus groups). impacts will be assessed by comparing different outcomes, in particular proposal submissions to nsf, before and after participating in the intervention across a treatment group of mentees and a control group of those who applied but were not admitted. findings will be disseminated at academic conferences, meetings with federal agencies such as nsf, and by means of a final report to be posted on the national bureau of economic research."
Collaborative Research: The Impact of Covid-19 on Victimization Risk and Service Needs for Domestic Violence Victims and Survivors,"there is increasing evidence that the covid-19 pandemic has exacerbated domestic violence. there are many commendable and promising programs to respond to domestic violence, but it is not known how these programs cope in the pandemic environment to serve domestic violence victims and survivors, and especially individuals from diverse backgrounds and living in disadvantaged communities. this collaborative study builds a nationwide inventory of domestic violence victim programs including critical information about these programs' services. it will also generate critical knowledge on strongest predictors of domestic violence and strategies for efficient service provision and servicing underserved populations. this study will address the urgent need for programmatic research to advance the knowledge of domestic violence risks posed by covid-19 and the availability and accessibility of nationwide resources for victims and survivors. the project integrates a multidisciplinary theoretical framework and a rapid assessment methodology to understand the multifaceted nature of domestic violence. the theoretical framework includes criminological, epidemiological, public health, service advocacy perspectives. this study will also assess the service needs of domestic violence victims to identify nationwide proactive and protective interventions against domestic violence. this study will use a mixed-methods study design and its objectives are to: (1) determine the known risk factors of domestic violence which have heightened during covid-19 and new covid-19 related risk factors for domestic violence; (2) identify protective factors against domestic violence during covid-19; (3) identify the immediate and long-term needs of survivors based on their demographics; (4) compile an up to date inventory of all domestic violence programs nationwide to assess service needs; (5) demonstrate the special service needs of victims and survivors for mitigating risks and prevention, and (6) translate the research findings and transfer the knowledge to the practitioner and scholarly communities nationwide. the study will gather data on existing services for domestic violence victims and survivors; covid-19 related domestic violence risk factors and service needs; and the barriers in providing and accessing services. the data will be collected via interviews, focus groups discussions, and a survey with victim service providers across the us. this study will produce evidence that will benefit practitioners, policymakers, and researchers working in the fields of victim services, public health, law enforcement, and community resilience."
Collaborative Research: Emerging Engagements of Energy Democracy,"on september 20, 2017, hurricane maria made landfall on the u.s. territory of puerto rico. the category five hurricane disconnected the island?s aging fossil fuel-based electricity grid and uncovered the shortcomings of puerto rico?s energy system in the context of ongoing economic crisis, energy transition, natural disasters, and climate change. as a result, puerto rico is at an energy crossroads: continue with status quo reliance on imported fossil fuels or make a transition to renewable energies, such as solar. the goal of this project is to analyze the post-disaster energy transition in puerto rico as a case study for understanding the ways people communicate about energy democracy. energy democracy is both a social movement that seeks to make decisions about energy technology as democratic as possible. this project collects data from fieldwork in puerto rico, interviews and focus groups with stakeholders involved in energy decision-making in puerto rico, and puerto rican media sources (tv, radio, and print) that report on and influence communication about energy transition and democracy. analysis of how different groups of people communicate about and justify competing visions for puerto rico?s future energy system will contribute to understanding current and future controversies over energy transition in the midst of the climate change, natural disasters, and other crisis events. the project?s findings will contribute to developing more democratic and just energy decision-making in a range of contexts. using qualitative fieldwork and news media analysis methods, this research will answer the research question: what are the forms of communication used by stakeholders (industry, citizens, government officials, activists, regulatory bodies, and scientists) in puerto rico to describe and justify energy transition in relation to democracy? this project will contribute to the emerging area of science, technology, and society (sts) research on energy democracy. the justice-participation-power-technology (jppt) framework developed by the co-pis explains how energy democracy relies on the intersections of these four elements in each particular context. this research tests the jppt framework?s applicability in the case of puerto rico?s post-disaster energy transition. furthermore, the project supports ongoing efforts by researchers to study how energy transitions relate to democracy; puerto rico?s evolving energy system; and the social, political, and cultural influences on implementation of energy technologies. findings can be applied to other energy technology controversies with stakeholders in similar geopolitical contexts towards designing energy systems that are democratic, culturally appropriate, and equitable. through collaboration with energy democracy practitioners in puerto rico, the project includes hosting community workshops, conducting research for grassroots energy organizations, and developing research-informed best practices for promoting energy democracy."
"Collaborative Research: Charismatic Politicians, Weak Parties, and the Disruption of Democracy","democracy is facing may challenges around the world, from the erosion of long-held democratic norms in mature democracies like the united states, to renewed party system upheaval in latin america and eastern europe, to the full-blown autocratic reversal in countries like turkey or thailand. this project studies how the obstacles that parties face in controlling their politicians interact with electoral rules, contextual conditions, and voter pressures to produce two phenomena that contribute to the erosion of democracy. this project develops general theoretical arguments, collects data on parties and politicians from multiple countries, proposes new strategies to measure party system instability, politicians? performance, and candidates? charisma, and summarizes the findings in general policy recommendations. in contributing to the understanding of the causes behind democratic backsliding, the project will identify policies and institutional arrangements that are most conducive to stable political parties and healthy democracies, two key components of national prosperity and international peace. the research program integrates three key components: theory development, empirical analysis and methodological innovation. the project develops a series of formal theoretical models that examine the understudied strategic interactions between political parties as longer-lived entities and their shorter-sighted individual candidates, under the premise that these interactions can help explain a variety of forms of democratic disruption. the project develops new methodologies to capture hard-to-measure concepts of politician charisma, incumbent performance, and party strength. using a series of quasi-experimental approaches and natural experiments, a rich set of novel empirical implications derived from the formal models are tested with data from multiple countries. the analyses both validate the theories and produce systematic empirical evidence to inform scholarly and policy debates."
HNDS-R Collaborative Research:  Measuring Belief Distortions to Improve Predictive Outcomes,"systematic expectational errors embedded in beliefs (belief distortions) can have important effects on the economy. this project aims to explore the relation between belief distortions and economic outcomes. the research will explore to what extent beliefs pertaining to key variables closely related to monetary policy, such as interest rates and financial aggregates, may be distorted. the project will also examine how the beliefs and sentiments voiced in polling, such as those pertaining to elections, may produce biased forecasts of election outcomes. in exploring these questions, the project will utilize textual data from written documents such as online news outlets and social media, and data from betting markets, which will further be combined with other economic indicators. by utilizing this data, the project will account for biases in surveyed expectations about the future path of monetary policy as well as the performance of polls and surveys in predicting financial market variables and election outcomes. the project will develop machine learning based methods to improve prediction and estimation in a range of settings that rely on surveys by uncovering systematic errors in survey responses, and by correcting these errors using artificial intelligence algorithms. these tools will provide considerable potential improvements in prediction accuracy of surveys in a variety of contexts in the economy. a fundamental challenge in addressing whether beliefs are biased is that no objective measure of such distortions exists. this research aims to address this challenge by leveraging advancements in machine learning. a general premise of the approach followed in this project is that big data algorithms can be productively employed to reveal subjective biases in human judgements in multiple contexts, thereby facilitating more accurate objective forecasts. the project will construct and study a comprehensive, methodologically consistent, econometric measure of belief distortions in expectations about future monetary policy and electoral outcomes, among other variables. this objective requires employment of large amounts of data related to real-time decision making and machine-learning tools to reduce sampling noise. data scraped from written documents will be analyzed using a latent dirichlet allocation type of model to extract high-frequency measures of the topics covered by news outlets and social media. data about election outcomes, betting markets, and financial market futures contracts will be added to a large real time dataset of economic information. the research will then incorporate these methodologies and data to study beliefs and possible judgmental errors found in survey expectations related to the future conduct of monetary policy, the behavior of financial markets, and the outcomes of elections. the inclusion of fast-moving variables taken from options and futures markets and scraped from online documents will enable high-frequency tracking of revisions in beliefs and objective forecasts. this framework will allow high-frequency revisions in beliefs to be connected to specific news and announcements to improve prediction accuracy."
Collaborative Research: Information and Markets,"this project analyzes the impact of information for the structure of markets. the use of information in internet and other markets has been revolutionized in the twenty by developments in technology. economic institutions are adapting to these changes. at the same time, there have been fundamental improvements in our theoretical understanding of the role of information in the economy, but these new insights are somewhat abstract. our project brings recent theoretical developments in information economics to bear on key economic questions in the economy. one component of our project addresses the new multi-billion dollar market for internet advertising. advertisers purchase the right to display advertisements to particular internet users (the display of one advertisement to a particular internet user is known as an ""impression"". because internet platforms have detailed information about users, it is possible to target users precisely, i.e., show particular advertisements to internet users with particular characteristics. the market for impressions has become very sophisticated. the research team seeks to understand the gains and losses associated with targeting impressions. this work will be an input into the important policy question of how internet platforms should be regulated. the team's work on the market for impressions will analyze new questions in auction theory. in particular, in the market for impressions, the publisher can use his private information about users to control advertisers' information about the value of particular viewers. providing more information will increase the efficiency of the allocation. but more information will also reduce competition and give more information rents to the buyer. the team plans to understand the optimal information structure for the publishers and see how the optimal policy translates into selling methods used in practice. a second component of the project will study ""price discrimination in competitive markets"". price discrimination when firms exploit information about consumers to target them with different prices. price discrimination has been most successfully studied in the context of a monopoly seller. when firms both compete with each other but also price discriminate, the analysis can become intractable. this is a good example of a setting where more insight and tractability can be gained by allowing richer information. the team plans to provide tight bounds on welfare outcomes and price distributions for a given distribution of heterogeneous values of consumers. finally, they want to improve our understanding of the relation between information and ""higher-order beliefs"". higher-order beliefs encode a population's beliefs about the world, their beliefs about others' beliefs and so on. what is the relation between representing information via higher-order beliefs and less structured representations? they will develop the connection, understanding how a many player formalization of ""more information"" translates into higher-order beliefs and identifying settings where higher-order beliefs can be used to approximate any information structure."
Collaborative Research: The Anatomy of Firm Exit: Theory and Facts,"firm exit is a significant contributor to overall job destruction. in addition to the jobs lost, firm exit permanently destroys intangible capital, such as customer-firm relationships and brand reputation. yet, the underlying drivers of firm exit remain relatively unexplored. this project will study which firm characteristics best predict firm exit, with a renewed focus on financial health. the goal is to determine which firms fail due to lack of long-run sustainability of the business activity (solvency) versus temporary restricted access to funding (illiquidity). the main hypothesis is that the latter is particularly salient in times of crises. providing a theory that explains the type of market imperfection behind this pattern is crucial in order to design effective policy interventions. the proposed framework will allow researchers to assess whether policy responses to covid-19 were adequate and suggest potential improvements in addressing future downturns. the first part of the project will study analytically the effect of financial distress on firm exit. the pis propose a two-period model of firm dynamics with financial frictions. firms are able to borrow funds from financial intermediaries using non-state-contingent debt to cover fixed operating costs. firms may choose to default on their existing debt obligations. if they do so, financial intermediaries can take over and operate the firm, but at a fraction of its initial productivity. as a result of the default option, firms face an endogenous borrowing limit, giving rise to inefficient firm exit. while inefficient firm exit or the level of financial frictions cannot be directly measured in the data, the model provides a mapping between inefficient firm exit and the conditional covariance of a firm?s propensity to exit with its debt holdings. the second part of the project aims to shed light empirically on the key drivers of firm exit. using firm-level data that includes detailed financial information, the pis will characterize the sensitivity of firms? propensity to exit to financial characteristics, and document how this sensitivity varies over the business cycle. the goal is two-fold. first, testing for the presence of inefficient firm exit in the lens of the analytical model. second, providing moments to calibrate a quantitative version of the model. the third part of the project quantifies the degree of inefficient firm exit over the business cycle. the analysis will be based on an infinite-horizon model with aggregate fluctuations and endogenous firm entry and exit. the pis will use the quantitative model to show how the welfare losses due to inefficient firm exit depend on the length and depth of recessions and on the magnitude of entry costs. finally, the pis will study the effectiveness of different policies aimed at alleviating firm exit inefficiencies."
Collaborative Research: Caution and Reference Effects,"understanding how we make decisions is essential to predict economic outcomes and to design optimal policy. decades of research documented how people often deviate from rationality and tend to do so following specific behavioral patterns. three of these patterns have been widely documented and are of particular importance in economics: the endowment effect (where the act of ownership increases the value that people associate to a good), loss aversion (the tendency to avoid losses over achieving equivalent gains), and the certainty effect (a bias towards risk-free options, in violation of expected utility theory). all three phenomena have been shown to play prominent roles in many contexts, including investment, medical, and educational decisions. in this project, the research teams introduce a new approach to study all three phenomena jointly as stemming from one single intuition: it suggests that all three can originate from the fact that individuals are sometimes unsure of what they prefer and act with caution. this approach makes novel predictions about the relationship of these phenomena and offers a novel tool to organize existing empirical evidence. the team will also conduct also conduct an experiment to test the new predictions of this theory. the results of this project may give us new insights into how to encourage people to save for retirement and protect their health. the research team wants to demonstrate that all three phenomena above (the endowment effect, loss aversion, and the certainty effect) are captured jointly by the cautious utility model. in this model, the individual has a set of utility functions?as if unsure of which one to use?and adopts the most pessimistic one to evaluate each option. the project shows that the cautious utility model is characterized axiomatically from imposing a (known) weakening of the independence axiom of expected utility that rules out the opposite of the certainty effect. it then shows that this model implies loss aversion and the endowment effect?ruling out the opposite. this establishes a strong theoretical link between these phenomena. they will also show how this model can be used to organize existing empirical evidence, including observations at odds with leading alternative models. finally, they plan an experiment that tests the critical novel predictions of the cautious utility model on the empirical relationship between these phenomena."
Collaborative Research: Dignity and the Movement of Displaced Populations,"collaborative research: dignity and the movement of displaced populations co-pis: margaret e. peters & yang-yang zhou abstract this project examines how civilians facing high levels of insecurity due to conditions of armed conflict and economic crisis make decisions whether to leave their country of origin, where to settle if they decide to leave, and when to return home. this project focuses on internal values, such as dignity concerns and nationalism, that may influence this decision-making process in the context of multiple countries where crises of population displacement are present. the findings of this project will be of importance to u.s. national security as displacement events have become increasingly common in the last decade and can destabilize neighboring countries, including key u.s. allies, and pose complex challenges for humanitarian aid policies to affected populations. while existing scholarship focuses largely on how economic and security factors shape displacement decisions, this project theorizes that civilians seek to restore a sense of dignity regarding their family and professional life when making such decisions. as a result, they will compare the prospects of restoring dignity by leaving their home and locating in a new country with the prospects of rebuilding dignity at home. to test this argument, the project will conduct statistical analyses of original data collected from a series of survey studies of civilians in different countries along with behavioral games. this research will make significant contributions to scholarly literatures on individual and household crisis decision making in situations of displacement as well as research on humanitarian aid and response policy spanning multiple social science disciplines."
Collaborative Research: Origins of Serial Sovereign Default,"abstract sovereign nations have consistently borrowed from international financial markets for centuries, and this foreign debt remains an important source of funding for advanced and developing countries to the modern day. what sustains the existence of this market when there is no formal legal means of enforcing repayment? standard economic models predict that defaulting on sovereign debt is deterred by the threat of investors refusing to engage in future lending. however, historically countries differ significantly in both their likelihood of default and ability to re-access financial markets after default. this research will examine what leads some countries to become serial defaulters ? experiencing repeated cycles of borrowing and default ? while others do not. this project will assemble a new database on sovereign borrowing and default consisting of both numerical and textual data. these data will document detailed default and debt issuance history as well as the perspectives of the general public, investors, and analysts. the project will have potential policy implications for sovereign borrowing decisions around the world, by improving the understanding of the reasons for sovereign defaults and investor willingness to lend. this research will investigate why some countries experience cycles of repeated borrowing and default. the project will build a new quantitative and textual database on sovereign borrowing, default, negotiations with lenders, and the economic and political circumstances relevant to sovereign debt. to assemble these data, the project will develop new adaptations of machine learning methods for natural language processing (nlp) to extract and analyze text. the data will be obtained from the universe of articles from major financial newspapers, annual reports by investors, and periodical publications by financial analysts. the project will develop a new deep learning model to correct for common optical character recognition (ocr) errors. the project will further construct new text libraries to aide in nlp content classification, which will allow determining how investors perceive the motive of the sovereign, such as economic or political, in issuing or defaulting debt. the project will categorize countries as being a serial defaulter based on the frequency and duration of their defaults from 1820 to 1939. the research will then document how the political and economic circumstances of borrowing and default, including public, investor, and expert perceptions of the sovereign's motives, influence serial default decisions. what determines sovereign default and investor willingness to lend is not only relevant for understanding the history of sovereign debt but has implications for ongoing policy debates over debt restructuring, payment moratoriums, and bailouts."
Collaborative Research: A Spatial Analysis of the Distribution and Consequences of Health Care Policy Implementation in a Federal System,"the federal government works alongside states as well as federally qualified health centers (fqhcs), private sector entities, and non-profit organizations to implement policies aimed to promote the health and well-being of americans. by shifting resources from the federal government to the states as well as local organizations, those who are closest to the public can tailor health policy to the needs of its residents. however, there is variation in the types of barriers the public may face in accessing these resources. this is especially true in low-income rural and urban localities. this collaborative project examines how various factors influence the allocation of public resources by using the case of title x, a unique program whose resources are allocated in many ways across the 50 u.s. states. the project also assesses the link between efficient and equitable resource allocation and local health outcomes. the project provides insights for policymakers to ensure that the american residents who are most in need of support are able to obtain the resources intended to enhance healthy public outcomes. insights and methodological advances from a wide array of disciplines?public policy, geography, city and regional planning, and health policy?contribute to the project?s development of a nuanced, accurate measurement of access to specialized healthcare resources to ascertain the extent to which state and local governments allocate federal resources in efficient and equitable ways and examine how public health outcomes respond to various modes of policy implementation. the project incorporates geographic information systems (gis) and statistical/spatial analysis?specifically the integrated two-step floating catchment area (i2sfca) method?as well as regression and factor analysis to gain leverage over multiple forms of data (e.g. u.s. census data, demographic variables of state legislatures, public health measures). these analyses highlight the determinants of equitable access to federally-approved reproductive healthcare resources across united states as well as the consequences for those who live within spaces where high-quality resources are not accessible."
Collaborative Research:  Network Formation and Bargaining with Exclusionary Commitments,"a lot of economic activity involves two-sided markets in which firms on one side of the market form networks with firms on the other side. in many of these markets there are small numbers of firms on each side, and contracts are negotiated bilaterally. the equilibrium network structure and terms of trade are intertwined and emerge through the strategic interactions of buyers and sellers on both sides of the market. examples include the market for health insurance in which hospitals negotiate rates with health insurance providers, the market for digital media in which tv stations and other content providers negotiate prices with cable companies and streaming platforms, and manufacturing networks in which downstream firms sign contracts with upstream suppliers. the broad goal of this project is to investigate models of bargaining between multiple buyers and multiple sellers in which each agent may potentially contract with several others on the opposite side of the market. a narrower goal, and the one we will first investigate, is to understand the role of exclusionary pre-commitments. for instance, a seller facing multiple buyers may find it profitable to create artificial scarcity by committing to trade only with specific subsets of buyers. the research will offer new perspectives on exclusion commitments and how they shape network structure and terms of trade for each link that forms. providing a systematic framework for analyzing exclusion commitments and network formation in ?thin? markets will expand the toolkit available to applied researchers in health economics and other two-sided markets as well as to policymakers and regulators. the project will develop a general definition of exclusion commitments compatible with flexible network formation, and will provide powerful characterizations of optimal exclusion commitments for settings without externalities. the research will reveal that flexibly trading with a fixed number of buyers enables sellers to extract higher profits than threatening to exclude particular buyers. in equilibrium, some buyers are included with certainty and split the marginal surplus equally with the seller. buyers with lower valuations are excluded with positive probability; bargaining with these buyers is driven by a novel sequential outside option principle. the conclusions will be extended to settings with externalities in which agents on the same side of the market are divided into different categories, and valuations are interdependent within and across categories. in earlier theoretical work and applications, there has been heavy reliance on the ?nash-in-nash? bargaining solution and closely related concepts. preliminary analysis suggests that this reliance might be excessive, and that the nash-in-nash framework could lead to conclusions at variance with the predictions generated by plausible and familiar bargaining protocols. developing new models of bargaining between multiple buyers and sellers based on natural protocols will contribute to an area that still lacks a settled theory."
"Collaborative Research: Heterogeneity, Risk Premia, and Macroeconomic Fluctuations","abstract financial assets differ in their exposure to aggregate risk. investing in the stock market, for instance, is substantially riskier than investing in short-term government bonds. there is substantial heterogeneity across households, financial institutions, and countries in their portfolios of these assets, suggesting that investors differ in their capacity or willingness to bear risk. this project studies how this heterogeneity matters for the transmission of business cycle shocks and macroeconomic policy. the project will improve our understanding on macro-financial linkages and will have potential implications for monetary policy and financial markets. the project bridges recent advances in heterogeneous agent new keynesian models and asset pricing with segmented markets, which have been largely disconnected. the proposed research accounts for aggregate risk, heterogeneity in portfolio choice, and nominal rigidities within a unified framework. the project aims to explore research questions on the transmission of macroeconomic shocks by taking into account the relationship between movements in risk premia and the real economy. the project will further consider the role of the dollar in the international financial system, and the role of asset prices in the design of optimal stabilization policy."

Collaborative Research: Pollution Mitigation and Productivity in Developing Countries,"the economies of many developing countries have experienced huge transformations over the past 20 years, but a major cost of development has been air and water pollution. the fact that pollution remains a central problem suggests that it may be very costly to mitigate pollution, in terms of lost productivity and revenues. an opposing view is the ""porter hypothesis"" that postulates that environmental policies lead to greater productivity. the current empirical evidence on these tradeoffs is both limited and ambiguous, with some studies finding a substantial productivity cost of pollution mitigation and others finding evidence in favor of the porter hypothesis. this research conducts a detailed empirical evaluation of whether policies in developing countries to lower pollution have been successful. the investigators also quantify the productivity and distributional costs of these policies. this research investigates these questions for both the manufacturing and power generation sectors. this research makes a significant contribution to intellectual merit, through its use of novel data, its innovative identification, and its use of frontier methods. this research is among the first to combine firm-level panel datasets on industrial production, power plant investment in environmental mitigation technologies, and air and water pollution discharges, in developing or developed countries. the investigators develop new sources of identification to understand pollution in developing countries by focusing on panel variation in environmental discharge fees and pollution reduction mandates. using the detailed data, the investigators also evaluate whether pollution mitigation policies cause firms to invest in new mitigation technologies or simply reduce their output."
Collaborative Research: Electoral Systems as Incentive Structures for Interparty and Intraparty Politics,"why does the nature of representation vary across countries, states, and localities? despite the fact that most politicians work hard to prove they deserve re-election, citizens often express frustration with the behavior of their elected officials. this project develops a new data set based on at least 2750 elections for national legislatures in nearly 150 countries for a 75 year period. the data will be used to test to what extent the type of representation citizens receive is a function of the electoral rules used to choose their representatives. specifically, the project examines whether electoral rules explain variation in interparty politics ? the number of parties and the variety of the policies they promise ? and intraparty politics ? the balance representatives strike between offering their constituents programmatic policy or particularistic rewards and constituency service. this project tests whether electoral rules explain variation in interparty politics ? the effective number of parties, parties? locations in the policy space, congruence between citizens? preferences and policy ? and intraparty politics ? the content of campaigns, the amount of constituency service provided, the design of legislative institutions, levels of party discipline, and the balance struck between programmatic policy and pork barrel politics. the effort is unique in two ways. first, the project compiles a dataset with the details of the systems used to conduct more than 2,750 elections for national legislatures in nearly 150 countries for a 75-year-period. second, it uses simulations to transparently generate interval-level indicators of the extent to which , on the interparty dimension, electoral systems encourage voters to express their heterogeneous preferences for a wide array of offerings and, on the intraparty front, allow voters to fill legislatures with noteworthy individuals as opposed to party automatons."
"Collaborative Research: Foreign Capital Liberalization, Structural Change,  and Economic Empowerment of Vulnerable Groups","many countries have promoted increased foreign capital liberalization as a path to economic growth and development. however, little is known about the social consequences of these policies. this research project will study the socio-political and distributional effects of foreign direct investment (fdi) induced by these policy changes. using the staggered liberalization of access to foreign capital across several industry groups, the research will attempt to answer the following questions: (1) does foreign capital liberalization in the manufacturing and/or service sector accelerate the process of changing the structure of economies? (2) what are the social, economic, health, and political, and distributional consequences of foreign capital liberalization policies, especially for vulnerable groups, such as women, racial and other minorities? the research project will build a large data set disaggregated at local administration level to study these issues. the results of this research project will guide policies to deal with the possible economic effects of foreign direct investment. it will also provide guidance on policies to decrease the possible negative social consequences and distributional effects of foreign direct investments. this project exploits the staggered liberalization of foreign capital flows to different disaggregated industries at different times to measure the causal average and distributional effects of foreign capital liberalization. this project has two parts: the first part measures the effects on occupational switching, gender attitudes, human capital, and fertility. the second part will measure the effects on social outcomes related to the rise of populism, such as crime, political attitudes, and religious violence. treatment of industry by foreign capital liberalization is measured by the pre- and post-reform mix of industries in a district. the analysis will then use a local labor market difference-in-differences (diff-in-diff) strategy to compares outcome change in affected and non affected districts from the pre- to post-reform period. the project will build panel datasets that will be harmonized at the district-level to measure the distribution effects of policy changes. this project will provide one of the first causal evidence on the effects of foreign capital liberalization on structural change as well as on a broad range social effects, such as female labor force participation, fertility, and education. the results of this project will provide guidance on policies to decrease the possible negative social consequences and distributional effects of foreign direct investments."

Collaborative Research: Honest and Robust Inference with High Dimensional Data,"modern data analysis in economics and other sciences often involves situations in which researchers are interested in making predictions about or explaining the behavior of many individuals; researchers may also be interested in how a single factor affects an outcome but have to include several other factors in explaining the outcome of interest. testing for statistical uncertainty surrounding the measured effects in these situations is difficult and existing methods do not provide precise and efficient ways to measure this uncertainty. this research project will develop new and improved methods for accessing statistical uncertainty associated with effect measurements in both situations. these situations arise routinely in economics and other social science research that addressing many policy questions, and accurate methods for assessing uncertainty are important for providing good policy recommendations. the results of this research project will help improve the quality of policy evaluation and statistical prediction and as result, provide policy makers with better advice. this will contribute to better policy outcomes, hence foster faster economic growth in the us. this research project will develop new methods to test statistical uncertainty in high-dimension data estimation in two settings. in the first setting, we develop a general method for constructing intervals that satisfy an average coverage property: the intervals cover a prespecified fraction (95%, say) of the true effects on average. focusing on average coverage allows us to form intervals that automatically reflect efficiency gains from data-driven regularization, including empirical bayes methods, and estimators of a regression function based on machine learning techniques. such gains are not possible under the usual notion of coverage, under which a coverage guarantee is required for each effect individually, not just on average. in the second setting, we focus on the usual notion of coverage. to obtain informative confidence intervals, we exploit a priori restrictions on the magnitude of the control coefficients. we show that our construction enjoys several optimality and near-optimality properties. the results of this research will improve the quality of policy advice and as a result increase the rate of economic growth in the us."
Collaborative Research: Experiments on Procedures and Prediction in Economic Decision Making,"this project contributes to research in behavioral economics. we know that standard economic models of individual behavior often do not accurately describe how people behave in specific situations. another way to say this is that these models are not descriptive. however, these models are built on assumptions that people may think include valuable principles that should guide behavior. if this is the case, then these standard canonical models would instruct people on how they should behave. such a model would be prescriptive, because it prescribes the behavior that people should choose to follow the principle. this project examines whether or not standard economic models are prescriptive in laboratory decision making experiments. the results of this research will further our understanding of whether and how economic models of individual behavior can guide policy interventions. this project will develop two novel experimental methods to assess the normative (prescriptive) nature of expected utility, discounted expected utility, and subjective expected utility. the first methodology will treat axioms as procedures that make a choice on behalf of the individual. indi- viduals will see axioms represented in a visually simple manner and will report whether they want their choices to be consistent with the axiom. then, individuals will make choices from decision problems related to the axiom, and will be given the opportunity to reconcile any discrepancies between their preference over axioms and choices. this methodology will test whether individuals treat the axioms as normative in decision-making, even in situations where they originally violated the axiom. we will employ this methodology in the domains of temporal choice and choice under risk and ambiguity. the second methodology will directly elicit whether individuals prefer recommendations that are predicted by a model. this will reveal whether the model itself is viewed as normative by evaluating predictions, without needing to explain the model to experimental participants. we will employ this methodology to study the normative appeal of expected utility theory. together, this research agenda will show whether individuals want their choices to be consistent with canonical economic models. if they do, then the frequently observed violations of these models might be better thought of as mistakes rather than reflecting underlying preferences."
Collaborative Research: Routine Maintenance of Registration Lists,"databases that contain information about people need regular attention to keep them up-to-date as individuals move, die, become inactive, or otherwise change status. the refreshing of state and local registration lists must therefore take place periodically to prevent the integrity and usefulness of the data from degrading. across the united states, though, the particular practices used to maintain registration lists vary with local conditions and traditions. the effects of data-updating choices implemented during the pandemic are particularly hard to understand. this project therefore investigates the relationship between demographic data and registration list updates. variables of sociological interest in this context include the procedures used, the officials responsible for the process, the socio-demographic characteristics of communities, and the regional effects of covid-19. to test hypotheses about these variables, the project compiles an open database of list maintenance procedures that can serve as a public resource. this can help scholars, data scientists, and decision-makers better understand the menu of alternatives available to protect the accessibility, accuracy, and security of such lists. across all 50 u.s. states, the project will match data about registration lists, the demographics of individuals, the socioeconomic characteristics of their communities and officials, list maintenance procedures, as well as covid-19 disruptions and responses. the study will use longitudinal, multilevel, and spatial analysis to test hypotheses about different ways of performing maintenance on registration lists. this project is jointly funded by the sociology program and the established program to stimulate competitive research (epscor)."
Collaborative Research: Debt and Insecurity Among Vulnerable Communities During the COVID-19 Crisis,"in this project, two questions are investigated: first, how financial difficulties were distributed within low-income communities before and during the covid-19 pandemic and, second, the extent to which social welfare decisions mitigated or exacerbated debt burdens and which of these decisions were most (or least) successful in protecting low-income families from serious financial difficulties. when faced with economic insecurity, many americans take on debt. although access to credit can provide families a resource in times of crisis, debt is often burdensome to repay for low-income families, and can exacerbate, rather than relieve, economic strain and insecurity. with the onset of the covid-19 crisis, many americans faced sudden and new sources of economic insecurity, and official responses to the pandemic were diverse. this study contributes to understanding the combined effects of debt and official responses in low-income communities when a crisis strikes. one important goal of this project is to inform decision-makers about low-income debt and economic insecurity during the covid-19 crisis in order to increase the effectiveness of future interventions. the research questions are addressed through linkages of consumer credit, alternative financial services, and state data sets. levels of indebtedness in low-income communities are captured with zip-code level quarterly data on consumer credit, such as mortgages and credit cards. alternative financial service use?e.g., payday and title loans?is obtained from q1 2019 through q4 2020. these data are linked to state and zip-level data that include sociodemographic characteristics, covid-related constraints, and state-level social safety net procedures. analysis involves, first, description of debt patterns in vulnerable communities in the united states before and after the onset of the covid-19 pandemic. second, a variety of statistical models are used to investigate associations between debt problems and official responses to the pandemic in these communities."
Collaborative Research: Exoneration and Compensation: The Role of False Confessions,"instances in which innocent individuals are wrongly convicted represent serious travesties of justice because the actual guilty offenders may go on to commit other, sometimes serious, crimes and the wrongly convicted innocents languish in prison for years (on average, over 13 years for serious crimes). the processes involved with exonerating innocent individuals of wrongful convictions is not well understood. essential factors and aids necessary to facilitate these innocents? well-being and reintegration into society upon exoneration are even less understood. a growing body of research has demonstrated that, although all of these individuals are innocent, (a) the process to exoneration differs depending on the circumstances associated with the wrongful conviction (such as whether the person falsely confessed) and (b) the general public still perceives these individuals as not entirely innocent, not entirely deserving of reintegration aids such as job training and counseling, and less fit for office jobs. a better understanding of the processes involved with exoneration attempts and a deeper appreciation of the compensation and aids necessary to more fully make these innocent individuals whole is critical to informing and developing statutes and reforms that will facilitate their reintegration into society. although our legal system has witnessed a proliferation of exonerations for wrongful convictions across the last decade or two, the process leading to exoneration and the aftereffects of being exonerated are not well understood. differences in the process leading to exoneration, types and degree of aid, and timeliness of receiving aids have all been documented. given that innocent confessors suffer a series of cumulative disadvantages during their journey through the legal system, this project will examine the idea that innocent confessors have particularly onerous experiences. to address this idea, the project will use in-depth interviews with attorneys who have worked on exoneration cases, exonerees (who have and have not falsely confessed), and innocence advocates to examine structural-level (e.g., wrongful conviction in a compensation statute state or not; exonerated with assistance from an innocence project); case-level (e.g., false confession or not); and individual-level (e.g., exoneration status, race) factors that influence whether an exoneree receives no, partial, or full compensation, and the types of compensation to explore how these aids (or lack of) impact post-conviction well-being and reentry adjustment. the in-depth interviews are complemented with an experimental field study of thousands of employers in five locations, comparing their willingness to hire exonerees who did and did not falsely confess, guilty paroled offenders, and those with no criminal history. the findings have the potential to illustrate barriers to exoneree compensation, determine how receipt of compensation and aid (type and amount) can influence post-exoneration re-entry experiences, and causally demonstrate the obstacles exonerees face when attempting to find employment. the ultimate goal is to inform state and federal compensation statutes, leading states without statutes to adopt ones or states with statutes to revise their current ones?such as removing controversial restrictions around false confessions, including employment assistance to help exonerees better adjust, and other aids that many exonerees desire but rarely can access."
Collaborative Research: Optimal Parental Leave Policies in the Presence of Statistical Discrimination and Child Development,"this research project will use large data sets and modern economic theory and measurement methods to investigate the best parental leave policies for the us. it develops and tests a sophisticated theory of parental leave policy that accounts for how households and businesses make decisions about labor supply and demand as well as whether and how many children to have, taking into consideration government parental leave policies. this model provides a formal economic framework for analyzing arguments on several sides of the debate. rising female workforce participation and reduction in gender gaps in schooling and earnings are some of the most important changes in labor markets over the past few decades in high income countries. while several competing parental leave policies have been proposed for the united states, there is not much research to guide which of the competing proposals will be best for the united states. in addition to studying the best parental policy for the us, the project will also train graduate and undergraduate students in cutting-edge economic research. the results of this research project will provide guidance on how best to establish efficient parental leave policies for the us, thus improving the operations of the labor market. it will also help to establish the us as a global leader in parental leave policies. there is a large empirical literature on parental leave policies; however the evidence does not provide a unique verdict on the efficacy of these policies. on the one hand, these policies may foster gender equity and child development by enabling working mothers to combine careers and motherhood. on the other hand, these policies may have long-term negative consequences for women as they may inhibit women from building up their careers due to losses in work experience. this project addresses the optimal design of parental leave policies and various ways of funding them by presenting a theory of how households make decisions regarding fertility, labor participation and the allocation of resources, how leave policies affect these decisions, and how profit-maximizing firms respond to these policies. the project provides a framework for the assessment of the optimality of paid family leave policies combining quasi-experimental policy variation with an explicit, structural modeling of the mechanisms through which female employees and their employers may respond to these interventions. unlike earlier research, this research considers statistical discrimination, household bargaining, and child development together in a general equilibrium model of the labor market. the semi-parametric, structural difference-in-difference approach of the project facilitates rigorous testing of the various mechanisms through which both sides of the market respond. the results of this research project will provide guidance on how best to establish parental leave policies, thus improving the operations of the labor market. it will also help to establish the us as a global leader in parental leave policies."
RAPID: Collaborative Research: Non-state Service Provision in the Context of Multiple Extreme Events,"this research concerns government and non-state actors' capacity to respond to simultaneous crises involving major disasters. in response to major disaster, the disaster state often delegates authority and encourages non-state service provision. often, response capacity depends on service provision by self-directed groups and businesses that are not electorally accountable. little is known about how the reliance of governments on non-state actors shapes the ability of the disaster state to respond to compounding crises. using the state of texas response to both covid 19 and winter storm uri as the compounding crises of interests, the pis consider 1) the role of non-state actors in supplementing state capacity; 2) the implications of reliance on non-state actors for resource allocation and service provision across differing communities; and 3) the implications of this reliance for democratic accountability. methodologically, the pis use a longitudinal three wave survey of local health agencies, emergency management departments, and non-profits operating in texas. the pis focus on the moments of crisis to allow for test of hypotheses about the role of non-state actors and democratic accountability. the gathering of baseline data in relatively close proximity to the dual events is an essential component of this project. this research will provide a baseline for the study of the disaster state. the pis use a theoretical framework of state capacity to examine the disaster state and to integrate scholarship on american governance with literature on non-state service provision in the field of comparative politics. the pis contribute to literature on state strength, distribution of non-state services and democratic accountability. the pis conduct three state-wide survey waves in texas in the aftermath of covid 19 and winter storm uri. in addition, the pis conduct semi-structured interviews with representatives of government agencies and with representatives of non-state actors. surveys will be implemented using the qualtrics platform. respondents for the initial survey will be recruited from texas?s 161 local health departments, public health districts, and local health units. with this survey data, the pis test three research hypotheses related to state capacity, public/private interaction, and compounding crises. the pis will generate basic scientific advances that may be applied by scholars seeking to understand and prepare for future multiple hazard situations. this research includes graduate student training and findings from the study will be shared with public officials and practitioners through a research and practice integration workshop."
Collaborative Research:  Responses to complex disruptive events: Cognition in a socio-political context,"health and economic crises, extreme storms, and other complex and disruptive events require decisions under high levels of risk and uncertainty. in these contexts, individuals often turn to trusted sources, such as close relations, community leaders, and political officials, for information about risks, responsibility and how to best respond. some of these public actors are motivated to strategically highlight certain narratives surrounding such events, which can in turn shape the risk perceptions, beliefs and responses of their constituencies. through a series of surveys, stakeholder interviews and social media analysis, the research team examines the factors that shape how individuals are impacted by, make sense of, and respond to extreme weather and other climatic pressures; and how public officials and other elites frame these events and communicate responsibility and blame. this research contributes to interdisciplinary research and psychological, social, and political theory by considering the interactions between individuals and the broader sociopolitical context. this work has implications for communication and policy making around complex, disruptive events, such as the covid-19 pandemic or other global change processes, and offers insights into how policy makers might tailor messages to different contexts and audiences. furthermore, the research uses a longitudinal design to predict whether certain behaviors are a gateway for more costly ones, or a scaffolding for raising environmental awareness, political engagement, and social norm change. coastal policy involves federal, regional, state, and local institutions that have overlapping responsibilities, which can lead to conflicting incentives. this work clarifies the net effect of these institutions on individuals and their responses. finally,the researchers co-develop many of the study materials in partnership with local organizations and policy makers in order to maximize the contribution of this study to improve the welfare and livelihoods of front-line communities, and future generations. specifically, this project evaluates individual and public attributions of and responses to acute extreme weather events and climatic pressures unfolding on longer timescales, such as sea level rise. the scholars examine factors and processes that shape how individuals are impacted by, make sense of and respond to extreme weather and other climatic pressures. they ask: (a) in complex disruptive situations, how do perceived causal attributions, risk, agency, response capacity, and behavior interrelate, and how do these relationships depend on individual characteristics or experience? (b) how do social and political influences affect individual decision-making, and are they more influential when individuals are more uncertain about the cause(s) of an event? (c) how do politicians and the media shape the narratives surrounding these events, and what are the implications for individuals and society? (d) how do behaviors feed back onto attributions, perceptions, and related behaviors? these researchers use a mixed-methods approach that combines surveys, qualitative interviews, administrative data and social media data to assess multiple outcomes evaluated together for the first time. the research contributes to psychological, social, and political theory by evaluating how individuals, embedded in complex physical and sociopolitical environments, make sense of and respond to ambiguous cues using social and public information. the work also has implications for communication and policy making around disruptive events, including pandemics and the looming crisis of climate change. political analysis provides insight into relationships between individuals and politicians, and the importance of creating structures that mandate investment in resilience and preparedness to counteract moral hazard. coastal policy involves federal, regional, state, and local institutions that have overlapping responsibilities, which can lead to conflicting incentives. the work aims to clarify the net effect of these institutions on individuals and their responses in order to improve the welfare and livelihoods of vulnerable communities."

Collaborative Research: Dealing with Disruption: Investigating the Micro-level Underpinnings of City Response to the Climate Crisis,"municipalities are grappling with myriad complex challenges linked to the changing climate. their responses to anticipated but uncertain disruptions exist on a continuum, from inaction to transformative change that fundamentally alters an urban system. we do not know enough about the factors leading cities to more or less transformative responses, inhibiting efforts to tackle such disturbances. to address this challenge, we propose the networked micro-decision context (nmdc), an arena where individuals involved in determining a policy response confer, negotiate, and act. this research assesses how two key dimensions of the nmdc?the composition of its actors and the flexibility of its structure?affect the transformative potential of governance. via the administration and analysis of a nation-wide survey, qualitative cases studies, and social network analyses, this research yields insight into the potentially nuanced ways composition and structure affect the transformativeness of a city?s approach to disruptions linked to the climate crisis. climate-induced disruptions share similarities with other mounting social challenges in that they are highly complex, affect multiple economic and governmental sectors, and are characterized by substantial resource interdependencies. as such, lessons this research produces can help understand and improve governance responses to other societal disruptions. this research examines and predicts when and how local governments pursue decision processes theoretically linked to a greater likelihood of transformative policy outcomes. in so doing, the research establishes the networked micro-decision context, which constitutes the micro-level, relational underpinnings of aggregate government behavior. the diversity of nmdc participants, the flexibility of its structure, and the presence of policy entrepreneurs are hypothesized as determinants of transformative governance, which is characterized by learning-focused, proactive, and risk-accepting processes. the research team leverages a mixed-methods approach to develop theory and test its generalizability, proceeding in three phases: (1) a large-n quantitative analysis, involving a nationwide survey and collection of secondary-source data; (2) in-depth case studies of 16 cities, employing interviews and archival analysis; and (3) a detailed social network analysis of the interactions that comprise the nmdc within those 16 cities. the network analysis is be coupled with the survey and interview-based findings to evaluate how a city?s likelihood of pursuing transformative governance processes around climate-related disruptions is affected by the nmdc?s balance between diversity and social cohesion; the position of climate policy entrepreneurs in the nmdc; and the nmdc?s diversity (organizationally and individually) and flexibility (operationalized as trust and fungibility)."
Collaborative Research: Continuity and Change in Remote Work,"for millions of u.s. workers, the covid-19 pandemic has ushered in a new era of remote work, which has shifted irreversibly the culture and technologies of work. this project will investigate continuities, changes, and disparities in remote work and its effects on quality of life. it will study workers? preferences for remote work, how people adapt to working remotely, and how remote work affects workers? well-being. the research will illuminate inequalities in remote work by considering varied experiences across life-course stages, educational levels, and demographic backgrounds. this project aims to provide decision-makers with strategic insights into the expectations and preferences of the american workforce, and to help employers optimize remote work arrangements. the project will field three new survey waves drawing from a nationally representative survey of 3,023 americans who worked remotely in some form after the onset of the covid-19 pandemic. the three survey waves build on a baseline survey fielded in october 2020. respondents are drawn from knowledgepanel, the largest probability-based online panel in the u.s. the survey combines widely used scales that measure working conditions, well-being, and worker preferences, with open-ended questions designed to capture workers? experiences of working from home and returning to in-person work. the study will track population trends in remote work across various subgroups. researchers will also use multivariate regression models to examine continuities, changes, and disparities in respondents? working conditions, quality of life, and adaptive strategies. the findings will inform sociological theories of work, health and wellbeing, and social and economic inequalities."
Collaborative Research: The Criminal Deportation Pipeline,"the mass deportation of immigrants with criminal records has formed the cornerstone of increasingly punitive immigration policy in the united states over the past thirty years. the major categories of crimes for which lawful permanent residents (green card holders) can be removed are broad and amorphous, and for undocumented individuals, any conviction can lead to removal. research has shown that racial and ethnic disparities profoundly impact the criminal justice system, adding to the risk of negative outcomes for black and latino immigrants in particular. we advance the concept of the ?criminal deportation pipeline? to describe the intertwining criminal and immigration system processes that funnel certain immigrants toward removal. the study, drawing on the disciplines of sociology and criminology, focuses on the factors which shape and constitute this pipeline. highlighting racial, ethnic and spatial disparities in criminal justice and immigration enforcement, as well as local policies and practices that aid immigrants targeted for expulsion, the study will demonstrate the pipeline?s functional presence in this iconic city of immigrants as well as factors that define its impact and character. the results of the research will contribute to the public debate on immigration policy and human rights reform while deepening our understanding of the relationship between citizenship, the law, and policing practices that have so impacted racialized immigrant communities. informed by theories of social exclusion and criminalization, particularly along the vectors of race, as well as the field of resistance, the study is oriented by the following research questions: (i) how do local patterns of non-immigration-related criminal justice enforcement shape the flow of the criminal deportation pipeline?; (ii) how do protective legal policies and practices affect the function of the criminal deportation pipeline?; and (iii) how do immigrants experience and respond to overlapping processes of criminalization and deportation? we will examine these questions using a mixed methods research design that combines 120 hours of targeted observation of deportation proceedings; secondary analysis of official documents and administrative government datasets; and 120 in-depth interviews with affected immigrants, legal practitioners, and community-based advocates. research will expand upon preliminary spatial analysis of high deportation areas in order to: (i) better understand how spatial, racial, and ethnic patterns in policing shape processes of criminal deportation; (ii) assess the function and impacts of protective legal policies, and (iii) identify the experiences of immigrants facing deportation with criminal records, as well as the impacts of overlapping criminal and immigration. the new knowledge produced will allow further development of theory around processes of social control, state practices and human agency with regard to the collective and individual immigrant experience."
Collaborative Research: School family nexus and educational differences during the Covid-19 pandemic and beyond,"in this project the adaptation of two crucial institutions in the lives of young people -- family and school ? in the face of the covid-19 pandemic and associated measures is investigated. research involves documentation of interactions between schools and families amid the crisis and analysis of the processes through which schools facilitate the construction of social capital among families even as they have closed school buildings and moved instruction online. subsequently, links are traced between these family/school interactions and students? learning experiences. results will inform research and decisions aimed at reducing disparities and fostering resilience. data consist primarily of three waves of survey of teachers, parents, and principals for a county school district in a county with considerable demographic and socioeconomic variation. these data are combined with administrative data for the school district as well as data on parent-teacher organizations and data from a statewide teacher survey of working conditions. these data are used to address several research questions, including: 1) how school and family collaboration varies with demographic and socioeconomic status; 2) to what extent this variation is attributable to differences in practices used during the remote learning period across and within schools; 3) to what extent school and family collaboration facilitates access to critical resources for students and their families; 4) to what extent school and family collaboration mitigates learning losses associated with the pandemic and related measures and how that varies by social group. this project has been supported jointly by the sociology program and by the science of broadening participation program."
"Collaborative Research: The Macroeconomy, Labor Markets, and Economic Mobility from the Civil War to Today: New High Frequency Data on Local Economic Shocks","abstract information on local economic activity is crucial to research and policy evaluation. it is an outcome of interest in the analysis of economic growth and inequality, regional development, and a range of national and local policies. this information is also an input to key questions about the behavior and welfare of individuals, cohorts, and firms. despite their paramount importance, systematic historical data on local economic conditions in the us are extremely limited. this limitation creates challenges in examining the evolution of the us economy during a period that includes geographic expansion, demographic and political realignment, and transformation from a rural, agrarian economy into an urban industrial one. moreover, it poses challenges in understanding more recent developments in the us economy, since many of these have historical roots, or depend on cumulative or historical exposure to shocks. this project will generate a long-run panel on local economic conditions in the us?one that is comprehensive, high-frequency, spatially-disaggregate, and available consistently over the period 1865-present. the project will further illustrate the research potential of this new dataset and provide the first systematic, high-frequency evidence on local economic conditions in the us prior to the 1970s. the panel dataset will comprise deposits of all households and firms in each county-year from 1865-present. for the period before 1960, the project will generate new data from the balance sheets of all nationally-chartered banks in the us, and supplement this with information on deposits held by state-chartered banks and other depository institutions. from 1961 to the present, the project will merge newly-collected data with existing information on deposits by county. the project will further explore deposits as a close and reliable proxy for traditional local economic indicators, such as employment or income, for which high-quality historical data are not readily available. an additional dataset will contain the detailed balance sheets of all us depository institutions underlying the county panel. these new datasets will have applications to all fields of economics, as well as across broader social science and policy evaluation spheres. the data will advance knowledge on the evolution of the us economy, fostering an understanding of critical local dynamics that previous data have obscured. by filling a substantial gap in the nation?s data infrastructure, this project will contribute to both economic knowledge and policy effectiveness."

"Collaborative Research: Economic Downturns, Global Pandemics and Parliamentary Elections","under what conditions do voters withdraw or withhold their support from governments and how do economic and pandemic stressors affect popular support for governments and political leaders? this project advances understanding of how electoral rules, electoral integrity, perceptions of regime popularity and longevity, and the nature of electoral alternatives shape government support. using surveys timed to russia?s 2021 parliamentary election and including questions from the comparative study of electoral systems, this project extends the longest running election study in an autocratic setting and the only covering an extended period of retreat from democracy. the data from this project are an important resource for scholars of authoritarianism, comparative electoral behavior, and political parties, and its findings are also relevant to journalists, policymakers and the public. existing scholarship gives good reason to believe that declining popular support can undermine regimes around the world. however, the precise nature of these processes and the long-term developments that lead to regime change remain poorly understood. this study uses a nationally representative panel survey conducted before and after russia?s 2021 state duma election to advance knowledge on two of the most consequential forms of political behavior and politically salient metrics of a regime?s popular support: turnout and vote choice. the project?s theoretical contribution focuses on key differences in how voters process information about government performance and assess available political alternatives, with special attention to how polarization, preference falsification, and voters? emotional states affect their interpretation of new information during crises."
Collaborative Research: Bidirectional Effects Between Parental Work-Family Conflict and Adolescent Psychosocial Adjustment,"parents of adolescents often feel like it is hard to carry out their obligations at work, while at the same time attending to matters at home. as a result of this work-family conflict, a parent may experience low morale at work, stress, and depression, all of which have profound effects on their work engagement and productivity. such tension between work and family may potentially impact the home environment as well, including negative effects on how adolescent children in the family think, feel, and behave. however, we know little about these effects, and also whether a negative home environment may have similarly negative effects on parents at work. our project seeks to study work-family conflict and its effects on the home environment (and vice versa) using controlled laboratory methods, and methods that allow for the study of these factors in ""real-life"" outside of the laboratory. by understanding the ways in which work-family conflict and the home environment influence each other, we may gain a better understanding of how to improve functioning in both work and home domain, and thus increase parents' work engagement and productivity. many employees in the u.s. experience high demands to fulfill obligations both at work and at home (galinsky et al. 2009). the incompatibility of heightened pressure from both work and home is referred to as work-family conflict (greenhaus & beutell, 1985), high levels of which place employees at increased risk for a host of poor work and psychosocial outcomes (e.g., job dissatisfaction, turnover, depression; allen, 2012). moreover, to the extent that child care poses demands in the family domain (bianchi & milkie, 2010), the children of employees are important stakeholders in the work-family interface. yet, the role of employees? children in absorbing the impact or being a source of work-family conflict has received scant attention. such issues are particularly important to address in families with adolescents. specifically, work-family conflict creates contexts in which parents have fewer resources or time to monitor their adolescents' whereabouts and activities, likely placing adolescents at high risk for poor psychosocial outcomes (smetana, 2008). in fact, relative to younger children, adolescents are more likely to display problem behaviors (e.g., depression and substance abuse) that increase parent-adolescent conflict, which may affect parents' time and energy at work. thus, we propose to address research questions within families who have adolescent children. specifically, we propose two studies that test both directions of a mediation model informed by the spillover hypothesis of life stressors (staines, 1980). based on prior work indicating that parent-adolescent conflict evidences reciprocal relations with children's psychosocial adjustment (burt et al., 2005), we propose that the reciprocal relations between work-family conflict and adolescent psychosocial maladjustment are mediated by parent-adolescent conflict. further, our team members have training in not only diverse social science disciplines, but also diverse research settings. accordingly, we propose two studies that test the model described previously in both field and laboratory settings, allowing each study's strengths to address the limitations of the other study. first, we will test both directions of the above-mentioned mediation model using daily diaries, completed by both parents and adolescents, conducted over a two-week period to measure work-family conflict, parent-adolescent conflict, parental work functioning, and adolescent psychosocial functioning. second, we will test the same theoretical model using a laboratory design. specifically, we will recruit family dyads with one full-time working parent and one adolescent for a laboratory study. we will randomly assign each full-time working parent and adolescent dyad to one of three levels of the independent variable: (a) task induction of parental work stress and a low-stress condition for the adolescent, (b) task induction of adolescent psychosocial stress and a low-stress condition for the parent, and (c) both parent and adolescent assigned to a low-stress condition. next, we will administer a controlled task meant to reflect parent-adolescent conflict (i.e., mediator variable), and we will objectively assess parent and adolescent physiological flexibility (i.e., an index of emotional dysregulation) during this task. we then will administer performance-based tasks of parental work functioning and adolescent psychosocial functioning to test the impact of parent-adolescent conflict on these domains, as well as the cross-domain, indirect impacts of parental work stress and adolescent psychosocial stress. the proposed project promises to improve our basic understanding of the spillover between parents? work experiences and non-work family life."
Collaborative Research: Innovation and Information,"abstract this project studies how differences in firms' beliefs about project feasibility, success and future potential profits affect research and development (r&d) activity. these differences may arise due to firms? prior experience with similar projects or how farther along a firm is in r&d process. firms have an incentive to learn what their rivals know. while learning about rivals? progress may be easier in some industries such as pharmaceuticals due to reporting regulations, it is challenging in other industries as firms protect their r&d specific information. the project is centered around three major research questions. first, the project explores firm incentives to share private information with others and its impact on the society. second, the research examines whether firms should make r&d progress public or not. third, the project looks at the reasons behind why startups focus on radical innovations and new products whereas established firms tend to pursue incremental innovations and improvements to existing products. the project has policy and regulatory implications in understanding the role of information asymmetry and information sharing on r&d activities for startups and established firms. this research focuses on r&d races where rivals have asymmetric information about the feasibility of the project. the project explores three issues. first, if firms can commit to be truthful, then the benefits of better information to a firm seem to outweigh competitive concerns. although firms should have an incentive to share what they know, this decreases the probability of success and is detrimental from a social perspective. second, firms can invest more in r&d if they do not share r&d progress publicly as information on a rival abandoning a line of research has a strong discouragement effect on others. third, the observed regularity about incremental and radical innovations can be explained in terms of information: smaller startup firms can usually observe the r&d activity of larger, established firms better than the other way around, which affects risk taking behavior. this project studies these issues in a rich setting incorporating imperfect monitoring of r&d activity by firms, capital constraints and intellectual capital. the project further considers implications of incremental and radical"
Collaborative Research: Collective decision making & local public good provision: Experimental Evidence,"participation in decision making by citizens and stakeholders has been widely promoted as a means to improved and sustainable outcomes in both domestic governance and international development. for example, the world bank has invested billions of dollars in community-driven development, which emphasizes the participation of beneficiaries in decision making around development projects. direct democracy, especially in the form of participatory budgeting, has spread across the globe. one motivation for promoting participation is the idea that by participating in decision making related to a local public good, participants will feel more compelled to invest in the maintenance of that good. in turn, public goods will provide more benefit to the community if they are well-maintained and last longer. political theorists, too, have posed the question: does participation ?make better citizens?? an even more important question for policy makers is: which kinds of participation manage to do so? this research evaluates the influence of participatory mechanisms on behavioral outcomes in one county in a developing country. the results of the study inform the ongoing design of participatory institutions in that country, other countries on that continent, and around the world; there are more than 11,000 participatory budgeting programs and programs are expanding far more quickly than evidence can keep pace. the results of this study thus are immediately useful to governments and advocates of participatory institutions as they design, adopt, and expand public participation in pursuit of development. the research uses a randomized controlled trial (rct) to evaluate the impact of common participatory processes on individual willingness to invest in local public goods, such as a well, a health clinic, or solar array. the rct takes place in 90 communities, where the researchers provide all villages with a local public good. the method of selecting a good for each community is randomly assigned to involve either: (a) preference aggregation through consultation, (b) preference aggregation through voting at a public meeting, or (c) consensus-building through deliberative discussion.the research team randomly recruits villagers to attend these meetings and surveys them on their attitudes and behaviors surrounding participation and development projects before and after the meetings. the researchers return 1 year later to measure the state of the public good and the participants? updated attitudes and behaviors. the researchers then leverage their strategy of random assignment of meeting rules and random selection of participants to compare villages across space and over time to identify the effects of the decision-making process on participants? selection and maintenance of the public good. this study thus provides rigorous evidence to inform future program design and investment in participatory institutions for development."
"Collaborative Research: Predictive Intelligence for Pandemic Prevention, Theme 4: Social and Behavioral Obstacles and Supports","although pandemics have threatened human civilization since ancient times, how to predict and prevent them remains a pressing challenge, calling for innovative insights and practices. pandemics emerge through incidental ?perfect storms?: molecular changes in pathogens, gradual trends in climate, subtle shifts in ecological interactions among potential hosts, and individual behavioral decisions by people, all colluding to make up the difference between an interesting but rare new variant of a known disease and an existential worldwide crisis. being able to predict the emergence of pandemic threats, therefore, requires a fully integrated, multidisciplinary approach, able to consider the complexity of these realms across scales of interaction to predict and, ideally, prevent. this workshop is one of four bringing experts from scholarly communities in the social and behavioral sciences, biology, engineering, and computer science together to discuss how to integrate the approaches taken by each community into a more effective, unified science of pandemic prediction. the focus of this workshop is on developing understanding of how human attitudes, social behavior, and the drivers underlying both shape patterns of infectious-disease transmission and efforts at control and eradication. this fundamental understanding in turn will facilitate pandemic prevention and control decisions that leave us better prepared when confronted with future pandemic threats. the workshop is structured to focus on four topical areas of crucial importance, dealing with cultural transmission, information and communication, equity, and sustainability. the white paper that comes from this workshop will provide important guidance for incorporating insights into the social and behavioral sciences into predictive intelligence and pandemic prevention. it will inform future research investments, institutional capacity-building, and other policy priorities aimed at keeping the us and the world safe from inevitable future pandemics."
"Collaborative Research: International Coercion, Debt Relief, and Land Transactions","national science foundation abstract proposal: 2048406/2048416 pi name: shea, patrick/bunte, jonas proposal id: 2048406/2048416 institution: university of houston/university of texas at dallas principal investigator: patrick shea/jonas bunte nsf program: security and preparedness title: collaborative research: international coercion, debt relief, and land transactions this project will determine when governments transfer control over portions of their national territory to pay off loan debts to international creditors. the project will provide systematic evidence on the domestic and international conditions that influence the decisions of governments to exchange land for debt relief. the empirical analyses in the project will be based on a new dataset to be collected on all land transactions between countries related to debt relief. the results of this project will contribute to improving our understanding of when the international debt problems of countries can lead them to make territorial concessions to other countries. the project will develop and test theory on the different debt relief strategies that governments can choose to adopt and why land transactions are sometimes selected instead of other available policies such as austerity or default. a new and more comprehensive dataset on land transactions for debt relief will be collected for the period 2000 to 2020. statistical analyses of the new data set, employing simultaneous equations, will be conducted to test theoretical propositions. the results of the project will advance basic research on the management of international debt, the use of economic leverage by states to gain concession from states on security issues, and the dynamics of international negotiations over territorial concessions."
RAPID: Collaborative Research: The Integrity of Mail Voting,"given the increase use of vote by mail (vbm) due to the covid-19 pandemic, the investigators focus on mail-in voters' experience with how they seek, obtain, complete, return and have their mail ballots counted. they examine citizens' perceptions about the integrity of elections using vbm by assessing concerns about variation in the institutional structures of vbm, the secrecy of vbm the process, and the coercion that vbm voters may face from their peer group. the investigators use a state-centric survey design that includes an oversample in 10 states that have a mixture of vbm systems. the oversample is important and gives additional statistical power and leverage about state election administration and laws. the sample consist of only registered voters who report voting by mail in the 2020 election. surveys are solicited online using qualtrics software. e-mail addresses for registered voters by state will be purchased from l2. the investigators completed 200 online surveys with mail voters in 40 states, and 1,000 with mail voters in 10 states, along with 100 in-person voters in each these states, for a total sample of 23,000. this research provides a baseline for concerns about voter integrity related to mail balloting. furthermore, it establishes whether alternative mail voting systems differ in terms of when, where, and with whom mail ballots are completed and returned. this project should inform scholars and policy makers in several areas of vbm policy administration. findings from the study are also valuable in increasing public confidence in vbm election procedures. the research involves undergraduate researchers at all three campuses of the collaborative study."
Collaborative Research: Sequentially Optimal Mechanism Design,"this award funds research in the economic theory of mechanism design. this area of economics focuses on understanding how incentives affect economic outcomes, with the goal of designing effective and efficient payment and reward plans. the project aims to expand mechanism design theory by providing a new tool to study the problems caused when long-term commitment to a contract is unrealistic. for example, online retailers, insurance companies, and banks interact with their customers over time. as these firms learn about their customers, they may want to change contract terms by making personalized offers to some customers. in the same way, governments may sign agreements about sovereign debt, but bailouts and renegotiation may change the terms of the original agreement. the new method has promise for new applications of this important area of economic theory, including a range of applications from debt and mortgage contracts, monetary policy, the design of online platforms, online privacy, and auctions for advertising sales. as a result, the research could result in more effective management methods for businesses and government policy makers. progress on optimal mechanism design under limited commitment has been hindered by a lack of a tractable methodology. the team will develop a new methodology based on the idea that a mechanism should encode not only the rules to determine the allocation, but also the information the designer obtains from the interaction. this means that how much the designer learns becomes an explicit part of the design. the project has three key parts. first, the team will develop this new tool, which will be akin to the use of the revelation principle in classical mechanism design. second, the team will use the method to characterize optimal trading mechanisms in infinite horizon settings. the characterization provides a solid foundation to coase's conjecture and the solution method can serve as a prototype to characterize optimal fiscal policy or social insurance when governments have limited commitment ability in infinite horizon settings. third, the team will examine the optimal design of information collection policies (for example, the use of cookies) and the resulting issues of transparency and privacy that arise when firms collect information about consumers."
Collaborative Research: NRI: FND: Grounded Reasoning about Robot Capabilities for Law and Policy,"abstract this award supports a research project that focuses on developing tools and best practices for promoting effective collaboration between legal and policy experts and roboticists. this collaboration serves two purposes: (1) to better ensure the safe and effective development of collaborative robots; and (2) to create effective and appropriate laws and policies governing their deployment in public spaces. the research team plans to develop a specification language and interactive tools for enabling reasoning about how robots and autonomous systems work, at a non-technical level. combined with ?what if?? case studies, this will facilitate dialog between technical experts and their legal and policy counterparts. the specification language and reasoning toolkit will be designed to evolve simultaneously with, and support, rapid changes in specific technology within the context of existing legal and policy frameworks. the team will use the legal concept of case studies to ground reasoning within a specific scenario. each case study will consist of a complete description of how the necessary robot capabilities might be implemented, complete with assumptions and potential failures. the results of this research will enable legal and policy experts and roboticists to more accurately reason about the intersection of robotic systems and legal and policy frameworks before either are implemented. specifically, this will support legal and policy experts in more accurately designing effective policy, legislation, and regulation around robotics that is meaningful and feasible, and will support robotic researchers in designing systems that incorporate legal and ethical questions into their design choices. the research team will engage in an interdisciplinary development of a structured language paradigm (comprised of syntax, semantics, and system descriptions) that supports grounded reasoning about robotics in law and policy contexts. these language paradigms will be instantiated as interactive experiences that enable embodied reasoning and metaphor exploration by experts and non-experts alike. these experiences will be developed around a specific set of near-term, feasible robot tasks, existing robot capabilities and known failure modes, metaphors to explain those capabilities, and specific scenarios that highlight common misconceptions. these experiences will be evaluated on their effectiveness in enabling non-technical people to reason about, and predict, autonomous system behavior. on the legal and policy side, the research team will engage with experts in these areas to develop specific hypothetical case studies (based on the identified tasks) that illustrate how to view technological choices through a law and policy lens. specifically, team members will work collaboratively to develop a set of associated design patterns that assist in mapping technical concepts to the structured language and the interactive visualizations, develop a prototype suite of interactive training applications, and construct a set of case studies for specific robot-use scenarios that enables meaningful dialog around law and policy and robotics."
Collaborative Research: NRI: INT: Customizable Lower-Limb Wearable Robot using Soft-Wearable Sensor to Assist Occupational Workers,"this award supports an integrative, collaborative project to develop a personalized lower-limb assistive wearable robot that reduces human effort during physically intensive activities, such as lifting. the robot works by sensing a user?s physical effort using soft-wearable electronics and responding accordingly to reduce this effort. this work has significant applications in factory labor involving weights, as overexertion injuries are both costly and frequently disabling. this research investigates the effectiveness of this wearable robot strategy in reducing human effort and develops strategies to improve the utilization of wearable robots and soft wearable electronics. the robot assistance to each individual human wearer is customized using an estimation method based on various metrics. the estimation method can also be used to design a training method using a wearable robot. the soft wearable sensors will be useful in robotics as well as medical applications related to diagnosis, monitoring, and therapeutics. the proposed project integrates research and education by developing a project-based course on wearable robotics and supporting graduate and undergraduate student mentoring in independent research and thesis studies. the project strengthens the infrastructure for education and research by helping maintain wearable robot testbeds. the research results will be broadly disseminated through publications, software, and data sets. the research team members have three objectives that contribute to the goal of customizability in wearable robot personalized assistance. first, the customization process will be improved by identifying alternative optimization criteria to efficiently estimate the user?s physical effort during physically intensive activities. this will be accomplished through a rapid and robust estimate of the user effort using a conventional physiological sensor, such as a muscle activity sensor, followed by an estimate using new soft wearable electronics. second, the work will enhance soft-wearable electronics with the goal of improving on and replacing conventional sensors. associated tasks will explore the feasibility of using existing soft wearable electronics as sensors and then iteratively improve the electronics and estimation method to accurately sense and estimate physiological status. third, the study will integrate and evaluate the personalized assistance achieved using soft wearable sensor measurements in a physically intensive activity, such as lifting using an ankle exoskeleton. this task will use appropriate metrics such as energy expenditure rate of the task and muscle activity. the work will result in customized (personalized) assistance available from a wearable robot for physically intensive activities and a soft wearable sensor system to evaluate the physical status of the user and provide real-time feedback. the evaluation outcomes can be applied in interventions to mitigate or prevent existing hazards and resulting injuries to workers; thus, the results of this research will benefit human laborers in factories, warehouses, and other industrial workplaces. this proposal was funded with the national institute for occupational safety and health (niosh) in the center for disease control and prevention (cdc)."
Collaborative Research: Assessing the impact of lead agency cross-functional authority on city sustainability outcomes,"local governments have traditionally been organized around function, with agencies and departments defined by the services they produce and deliver. although organizational structures compartmentalized according to specific expertise can produce efficiencies, this fragmentation becomes problematic when governments attempt to address complex problems that transcend multiple units. urban sustainability is an exemplar of issues which cut across numerous responsibilities traditionally held by distinct units within a single government organization. this research examines the relationship between municipal governments? administrative arrangements, their policy adoption and implementation choices, and sustainability outcomes. it highlights the role of lead unit cross-functional authority?which we define as the clout that an initiative?s administrative lead has over other relevant units in the city government?and assesses its impact on local sustainability outcomes. in so doing, this research contributes to an evidence-based understanding of how public organizations function in order to enhance their design, management, and overall effectiveness. this work advances convergence research drawing from organizational, policy, sustainable urban systems, and network science to increase the precision and robustness of the functional collective action (fca) framework. it provides important insight into the determinants of lead agency cross-functional authority?which extant research has highlighted as fundamental but inadequately operationalized?and its influence on policy outcome. using urban sustainability as our policy lens, we employ a mixed-methods approach to collect and analyze data from focus groups of local government officials, public and private archival repositories, and a nationwide survey to: (a) develop a refined conceptualization and empirical measure of cross-functional authority that captures its various dimensions and mechanisms of influence; (b) develop a comprehensive national dataset of multiple sustainability outcome measures that are comparable across cities; and (c) create the first longitudinal database on local sustainability policies spanning a ten year period, which is often considered the minimum amount of time necessary for nuanced examination of policy implementation and policy change. the collection of data will enable improved testing of local institutional and governance theories and its analysis will facilitate advances in urban management and sustainability outcomes."
"Collaborative Research: Social Norms, Trust, and Intergenerational Flow of Innovations","increased productivity and economic growth partly depends on adoption of improved technology which in turn depends on the transmission of information about new technologies. young people tend to learn about new technologies before their parents who own productive resources and are wedded to old technologies and may not trust the new information they learn from the young. on the other hand, young people may mistrust elders and may not reveal appropriate information they think elders will not accept, thus slowing technical progress and economic growth. this research project will use theory and experiments to study how social norms affect the intergenerational flow of technological information and how best to solve this friction in information flow. in addition to intergenerational transmission of information, the research also studies whether there is a gender dimension to the intergenerational flow of technological information. the results of this study could influence the design of effective information interventions that induce intergenerational flows of knowledge to speed up technical progress. the results will offer valuable information on the constraints in the economic empowerment of young women. the results of this research has the potential to increase the pace of innovation and accelerate economic growth, and improve the living standards of americans. this research project will leverage a collaboration with ngo partners in 150 junior high schools to study the barriers in intergenerational flow of knowledge. the project focuses on beliefs held by parents regarding the level and relevance of students? school-taught technical knowledge, as well as students? assessments of parents? beliefs. it examines whether parents and students hold systematically biased beliefs; relates these biases to conventional roles prescribed for different configurations of parents and students by gender; and measures the effects of beliefs on intergenerational communication patterns, parents? acquisition of new technical knowledge, and the empowerment of youth. the research proceeds in four stages. first, a baseline survey will collect household demographics of participants in a school-based technical education program. second, the pis will elicit parents? and students? beliefs in interviews; and deliver technical information to a random subset of parents and students. third, the pis will survey productive inputs allocated to youth for their home production, the acquisition of new technical knowledge among parents as well as communication patterns between students and parents. finally, the study will track the impact of the information interventions on production patterns after two school years. the results of this research has the potential to increase the pace of innovation and accelerate economic growth, thus improving the living standards of americans."
RAPID Collaborative Research: Economic Preferences and Preventative Health Measures During a Pandemic,"the research team will conduct choice experiments combined with a survey to determine how the covid-19 pandemic may be shaping economic preferences. they also want to determine whether those preferences are correlated with preventive health actions taken by individuals. the project will include subjects from a variety of different racial and ethnic groups, to get solid information on the groups that to date have been especially affected by covid-19 in the united states. the project should help us understand whether and how methods developed for use in behavioral economics and consumer choice can also help us predict the extent of health promoting behaviors. the results may also give us new insights into how to best target public health communications. the experimental tasks will measure risk tolerance, time preference, altruism, willingness to contribute to public goods, cooperation, willingness to lie in self-protection, preference for competition, and over/under confidence. economic theory suggests that each of these aspects of individual preferences play a role in determining the extent to which a given individual carries out recommended health behaviors. examples of these behaviors are wearing a mask (altruism, willingness to contribute to public goods), truthfully informing others about possible exposure (willingness to lie), avoiding crowds and indoor spaces (risk tolerance, over confidence), and limiting social gatherings today for future benefits (time preference). survey methods will be used to measure health behaviors. the team will use the data to test whether or not economic preference measurements do indeed predict health behaviors."
Collaborative Research: Does Registration and Notification Policy Deter Adolescent Sexual Offending? A Prospective Study of Integrated Criminological and Psychological Theories,"despite controversy over whether even adults should be required to register as sex offenders, currently 41 states have some form of policy requiring adolescents adjudicated or convicted of sexual offenses to register with local law enforcement agencies upon completing their sentences. moreover, 30 states allow or require online community notification of adolescents who committed sexual offenses, posting information on public websites or ?registries? to inform residents about the young offenders living in their communities. registration and notification policies are partly rooted in deterrence theory, which presumes that the risk of these outcomes will prevent potential sexual offenders from offending in the first place. however, criminological and psychological theories predict different outcomes of these policies, and whether they actually deter adolescent sexual offending remains unknown. prior research suggests that many adolescents are not aware of the risk of registration and notification posed by their sexual behavior. moreover, even if they are aware, psychological science suggests that their developmental immaturity may override that knowledge and result in offending anyway. this interdisciplinary project investigates whether and how registration and notification policies deter adolescents from engaging in criminalized sexual behaviors that are common in their age group. findings will inform policymakers working to develop evidence-based strategies that effectively achieve justice while also protecting developmentally vulnerable adolescents from excessively punitive and stigmatizing outcomes. this study explicates the criminological processes that are prerequisite to general deterrence as well as the developmental psychological mechanisms that may condition those processes. specifically, it experimentally manipulates whether adolescents are exposed to educational information about the risk of criminal justice involvement and sex offender registration and notification associated with illegal sexual behaviors. the results will reveal whether and how, even when adolescents are aware that certain sexual behaviors are prohibited and carry legal risks, their ability to engage in rational choice and their perceptions of the net cost of sexual offending moderate the impact of registration and notification over the course of one year. this project?s experimental and longitudinal approach will allow for causal determinations about the criminological processes that are thought to underlie general deterrence as well as the developmental psychological mechanisms that may condition the ability of sex offender registration and notification policy to affect adolescents? risky sexual behavior. this will transform current understanding of relations between criminological theory on deterrence, social-developmental psychology, and legal policy."
Collaborative Research: Transparency and Misspecification in Structural Estimation,"much economic research seeks to combine economic theory and statistical modeling to derive policy-relevant conclusions from data. the transparency of this process?whether the intended audience can understand the evidence behind the conclusions as well as the conclusions themselves?is crucial to the success of policy relevant research. this project will develop a framework for understanding the process through which the results were achieved, as well as the communication of scientific findings to a diverse audience, apply the framework to important problems in applied economics, and study how economists can reach more stable policy-relevant conclusions from data that does not change with minor changes in data or methodology. the research has three projects: a study of scientific communication, a definition and measurement of transparency, and a project that focuses on how to achieve transparency in economics research. the results of this research will lead to more efficient and reliable policy relevant economics research. it also will result in more trust in economic policy research as well as the development better policies. the project will study transparency in scientific research. the research consists of three projects: the first project will use economic theory and statistical decision theory to propose and develop a model of scientific communication and contrast its implications with those of a classical model of statistics. the second project---transparency in structural estimation---provides a working definition of transparency for structural estimation and discusses approaches to achieving it. the third project titled ?instrument selection and sensitivity to misspecification in structural models? will develop and illustrate the importance of instrument choice in determining the sensitivity of estimates of structural models to misspecification. the results of this research project does not only contribute to econometric theory and practice but also to improvement of policy and program evaluation. this research improves economic and policy decision making, hence strengthens the us economy."
"Collaborative Research: Cognitive, social, and institutional dynamics of decision-making in complex hazard-prone environments","recent years have demonstrated the substantial threat that wildfires pose to communities across the u.s. this project evaluates how local-level wildfire protection planning processes shape social interaction and consequently the implementation of risk mitigation measures at both local and regional scales. these local planning processes confront a range of challenges that relate to the need to coordinate risk mitigation efforts at multiple spatial and administrative scales (e.g., spanning public and private lands) and to promote cooperation among diverse stakeholder groups with distinct goals for managing wildfire-prone landscapes (e.g., fire suppression, timber production, protection for threatened species). this project improves understanding of how risk governance networks affect policy learning in collaborative planning processes and the scope of decisions they produce, how social processes (such as learning, cooperation, and competition) affect the implementation of those decisions, and how interdependent decision-making processes affect the efficiency of risk mitigation at regional scales. understanding the interplay among cognitive, social, and policy processes is critical for reducing the vulnerability of communities to wildfire. through partnerships with the colorado forest restoration institute and other key groups, the project engages policy makers, outreach professionals, and other stakeholders in initiatives that contribute to the design of communication strategies and capacity building programs to reduce wildfire risk. this project addresses theoretical and empirical gaps in scientific understanding of how the structure of decentralized risk governance networks affects policy learning and decision making, as well as the capacity of collaborative groups to implement decisions. key research questions include: how do risk governance networks affect policy learning in collaborative planning processes? how do risk governance networks affect the scale and boundary-spanning potential of risk mitigation plans? how do social processes affect implementation conformance, and particularly the implementation status of large scale and boundary-spanning risk mitigation plans? how do risk governance networks affect the efficiency of risk mitigation at regional scales? in a departure from the abstract and generalized measures of policy learning used in much research on policy learning, the proposed research breaks new ground by evaluating learning through quantitative indicators of systems thinking in cognitive maps of collaborative decision-making processes. in so doing, the research makes significant methodological contributions through application of the tools and perspectives of network science to evaluate cognitive maps. likewise, rigorous assessment of implementation enables evaluation of how the performance of decentralized governance systems varies according to patterns of interdependence among decision-making processes. this research is critical for developing a more complete model of how cognitive, social, and institutional dynamics shape risk governance systems, and ultimately the resilience of communities and regions."
Collaborative Research: Understanding the Long-Run Effects of School Desegregation on Political and Social Preferences,"busing was one of the two main ways through which public schools were desegregated in the post-civil rights era. while the effects of busing on educational outcomes have been studied, not much is known about the long term effects of busing on political ideology and social interactions. this research project will use historical data combined with a large survey data to study the long-run effects of busing on political, ideology, and racial attitudes of those who actually experienced busing. this study uses data from the ?louisville experiment? in which a lottery system was used to assign some white students to be bused to minority schools for two years while others were bused for one year with others not being bused at al. the researchers use this variation is busing assignment across different cohorts and between groups of students to study the effects of busing on political attitudes. this research results will provide a broader understanding of the effects of busing and its unintended effects generally. this research project combines archival data, a large survey data, and a difference-in-difference estimation strategy to estimate the causal impact of being bused on political preferences forty-five years later using a natural experiment from the mid-1970s in louisville, ky. the ?louisville experiment? assigned students to be bused at different ages based on the first letter of their last name. for the initial cohorts of whites, this resulted in some students being assigned to two years of busing while others received only one year or no busing. using this variation across cohorts and between groups of students with different last names, the research project will estimate the long-run causal impact of busing on political preferences and attitudes. specifically, the pis use difference-in-difference methods to estimate the causal effects of busing on partisanship, voter turn-out, and political donations. the research will also investigate the effects of busing on racial attitudes and support for income support programs. the results of this research will provide a better understanding of the long-term broader impacts of integration programs. it could inform policies to improve racial integration and probably improve social harmony."
Collaborative Research: Veto Bargaining: Delegation and Non-Coasian Dynamics,"this award funds research on the topic of veto bargaining. veto bargaining concerns situations in which one agent or group can make proposals but another must approve them. applications can be found in many areas of the social sciences: legislatures (e.g., u.s. congress) propose bills that executives (e.g., the president) can veto; criminal prosecutors bring charges that judges and juries decide whether to convict a defendant on; ceos and boards need shareholders to sign off on certain decisions; and search committees put forward candidates but the decision of whether to hire rests elsewhere in an organization. the central issue the research will take up concerns the uncertainty proposers face about the preferences of those with veto power?which proposals they are willing to accept relative to the status quo. using game theory, the pis will theoretically investigate how such uncertainty affects bargaining and the resulting outcomes. they will explore applications and implications in some of the contexts noted above. it is hoped that the research will contribute to both the theoretical and practical understanding of veto bargaining, and provide some methodological insights. the pis will adopt a framework of proposer-vetoer bargaining over a ?spatial dimension? of actions or policies; i.e., the agents have single-peaked preferences. vetoer?s preferences are her private information. the first part of the project will take a mechanism design approach to identify proposer-optimal outcomes when proposer has full commitment. this approach will be useful both normatively and positively. a connection will be made to optimal delegation. among other things, the results will show that under reasonable conditions incomplete information can dramatically corrode proposer?s bargaining power, while still resulting in efficient outcomes. comparative statics will be obtained concerning the proposer?s risk aversion and the alignment of preferences between proposer and vetoer. the second part of the research project will study a dynamic model in which proposer has limited commitment. that is, he/she cannot commit to not coming back to vetoer with a proposal in the next period should the current proposal be rejected. the results from the first part of the project will be used to understand how bargaining is affected by limited commitment. a familiar intuition when players are patient is that of coasian dynamics: regardless of the commitment solution, proposer?s lack of commitment should erode his/her bargaining power and lead to vetoer getting her ideal outcome, perhaps modulo some minimum ?outside option? payoff to proposer. the pis anticipate showing that this intuition fails here, owing to single-peaked preferences. in particular, it is anticipated that under some conditions there will be non-coasian dynamics, with proposer obtaining her commitment payoff."
Collaborative Research: Using Big Data to Analyze Maritime Conflict,"maritime conflict has been on the rise globally, with hotspots across the world's regions. despite growing coverage in the news media, among think tanks, and great attention from policy makers and politicians, there is limited systematic data on conflict incidents in maritime regions. this project will fill two important gaps. first, it will generate a multi-faceted dataset on maritime conflict that will be shared publicly for use by scholars and journalists. second, although theorists have offered many competing accounts for what to expect in the realm of maritime conflict, there have yet to be any compelling empirical investigations of what has taken place in the past decade. this project will develop data collection techniques that will be applicable to a range of maritime conflict-affected regions, which also have substantial national security implications. social scientists have increasingly turned to data-driven approaches to answer important questions regarding international security. within the world of conflict research, comprehensive datasets have played a critical role in advancing scientific knowledge (e.g. aiddata, cow, acled). thus far, however, there has been limited systematic empirical analysis of maritime conflict; a major hurdle is a lack of data. in this project, the pis acquire and consolidate comprehensive data on maritime incidents and make substantial progress toward empirically testing and resolving competing theories for how maritime conflict may play out over the next decade. the project refines prevailing theories of power transition, taking into account the slow but steady change in maritime capabilities of superpowers as well as the growing economic and political interdependence among nation-states since the end of the cold war, to generate new testable hypotheses. the analysis utilizes the overlapping eez zones and territorial waters, variation in off-shore natural resource distribution, and changes in domestic politics to test the proposed hypotheses. the data will be made publicly available and legible to other social scientists so that experts can replicate it for their own research purposes."
Collaborative Research: Implications of Solar Radiation Management for Strategic Behavior and Climate Governance,"with recent scientific reports warning of serious global impacts if greenhouse gas emissions are not quickly curtailed, some nations or other entities may be inclined to pursue a technological climate management strategy that does not require international cooperation. solar radiation management (srm) is emerging as the leading candidate from among a variety of potential ?geoengineering? technologies. srm seeks to increase the amount of sunlight reflected back into space to offset the heat-trapping effects of ghg emissions. one approach, which involves widespread release of reflective particles in the stratosphere, is expected to be especially cheap and fast?acting. this means that a single nation that is especially vulnerable to climate change may decide to deploy srm, even if it is potentially detrimental to other nations. this research project is designed to investigate how the potential availability and implementation of geoengineering is likely to impact future climate action and impacts. the research team also explores the ways in which alternative international governance frameworks might promote strategies that lead to the greatest global benefit. the project advances existing theory and models of climate action by considering the potential evolution of decision making as climate change becomes more urgent and nations struggle to reach a cooperative solution. this theoretical advancement is reinforced by behavioral laboratory experiments as well as computer model simulations. by providing insight into the wider ramifications of geoengineering, the research is timely and socially relevant. specifically, the researchers broaden the impact of the work via three main mechanisms: (i) direct engagement of domestic and international climate policymakers, to improve mutual understanding of the implications of srm; (ii) translation and dissemination of our modeling and experimental tools and results for application to other problems in science and technology policy; (iii) provision of socially relevant experiences for diverse students that develop their capacity to communicate with decision makers. climate change is a typical public goods problem, requiring collective action to successfully co-manage. global collective action on climate change is a challenge, however, as each potential actor has an incentive to ?free?ride? on the actions of others. this leads to insufficient overall action ? the so?called ?tragedy of the commons.? this situation may be transformed, however, by the potential of solar radiation management (srm) as a non?cooperative climate change management strategy. in particular, the injection of reflective particles into the stratosphere may be a sufficiently cheap and easy means of cooling the earth to be feasibly implemented by a single nation. however, srm is an imperfect solution as it is short?lived and has its own risks and governance challenges. in this project, we seek to understand the potential impacts of srm on future climate management strategy, the prospects of cooperative action, and the role of international governance. key research questions include: under what conditions will srm encourage free?riding, free?driving, or cooperation? will nations reserve srm as a last resort, or implement it before it is necessary? what role can srm play in a climate management portfolio that includes mitigation and adaptation? how will heterogeneity among nations in their preference for srm impact the potential for cooperation? how can international institutions rein in any free?driver impetus created by srm while incentivizing cooperation? this project addresses these and other research questions by connecting theory, model simulation, and experiment in pursuit of three specific aims: 1. develop and analyze a game theoretic model of the dynamics of international climate cooperation when some nations have the ability to implement srm. 2. design and implement experimental games that represent the key features of srm to test the theoretic model against actual behavior and to inform development of an agent?based simulation. 3. simulate and field test alternative frameworks for international governance and institutional design that promote climate strategies with the greatest social benefit. while our project is motivated by the prospect of srm as a non?cooperative, short?term solution to climate change, insights from our project are potentially applicable to any situation in which a risky technology is being presented as a quick fix for problems traditionally addressed through collective action. finally, the project team addresses opportunities for transferring the theory, modelling, and experimental rameworks to other settings."
Collaborative Research: The economics of social data,"this award funds research in economic theory. the rise of large internet platforms is leading to an unprecedented collection and use of data. the platforms generate massive amounts of data about individual consumers, their preferences, their locations, their friends, their political views, and almost all other facets of their lives. the availability of individual-level data allows companies to offer refined search results, personalized product recommendations, informative ratings, timely traffic data, and targeted advertisements. the resulting markets for data introduce a fundamentally new set of economic relationships. a central feature of the data collected from individuals is its social aspect. namely, the data captured from an individual user is not only informative about that specific individual, but also about users similar to her. thus, individual data is really social data. the social nature of the data generates an informational externality. that is, an individual providing information about herself affects the marketplace options available to others. this project will give us new insights into how data markets affect economic outcomes. the team will pursue a research agenda focused on data markets. the first step is to establish the theoretical foundations of our understanding of how information markets work. this research focuses on the social aspect of information collection, which leads to a newly understood ""data externality"" that can be associated with various market failures. this research seeks to understand why internet data platforms tend to become large dominant firms, and how this affects the welfare of consumers, advertisers, and publishers. the next step is to analyze whether and how large internet platforms can maintain and possibly extend their market power through various contracting and commercial practices, and how both antitrust enforcement and regulatory policy might respond. the team will investigate the likely industry equilibrium and competitive structure in such markets for data and information, and any possible regulatory interventions. more specifically they will develop new results on how the gathering of this kind social data impacts the economics of content providers (e.g., online, print, radio and television media). finally, how do the current contracting practices in the digital advertising markets accentuate or attenuate the data externalities, and the resulting social outcomes? these questions gain importance in the presence of the externality generated by the social data."
Collaborative Research: Creativity in Teams: Identifying the Role of Meetings in Fostering Effective Cognitive and Social Processes in Teams,"in the last two decades, interest in creativity and innovation has grown tremendously. creativity and innovation have been suggested as important for organizational performance. in addition, the use of teams in organizations is on the rise. the purpose of this research is to evaluate the interrelationships between social and cognitive processes in team meetings for generating a creative idea or product. the project will assess the team cognitive process sequences that effectively result in more creative ideas, the effect of team dynamics on these cognitive processes, and how cognitive and social processes interact to produce creative outcomes. we will further investigate whether an intervention to facilitate team creativity will improve creativity and the effect it has on both cognitive and social processes. to address these aims, two studies will be conducted. the first study will be a laboratory study, where teams will be ad-hoc, one-time meetings. these will be short-term teams that have no previous interaction. the laboratory conditions will allow for audio and video recording of the team interactions, which facilitates detailed and nuanced analysis of both cognitive and social processes. the laboratory study will also allow us to test an intervention using debriefs to facilitate reflection that fosters team reflexivity. building on the findings from this initial study, our second study will recruit semester-long undergraduate teams in engineering design courses at university of nebraska lincoln (unl) and clemson. these teams work to develop a product or idea based on real client demands, for a semester long project. as a result, these teams will provide an opportunity to understand ongoing interaction throughout a 3 to 4 month period. the study of these teams will allow us to understand dynamics that have consequences associated with teamwork and creative processes over time. this project is jointly funded by the science of organizations program and the established program to stimulate competitive research (epscor)."
Collaborative Research: Determining the Fundamental Cognitive Properties of Decision Making,"non-technical description of the project in nearly every decision a person makes, they are required to combine multiple, sometimes conflicting sources information. thus, understanding how people use these multiple sources of information is fundamental to understanding and predicting choices. established approaches within psychology allow examination these processes in some situations. for example, to explore decision stages, a decision-maker may be asked to describe her thought process when making a choice, and that description is used to inform the researcher. in many situations, direct information about the choice processes is not accessible. for example, a decision maker may search her memory to find the information that could be used for choosing between options. when memory search is fast, people rarely have clear insight into how the memories were accessed and used. to allow for investigating decisions based on multiple sources of information across the widest range of situations, the principal investigators will integrate a powerful methodology based on mathematical cognitive modelling with standard decision-making research methodologies. the research will accomplish three objectives: (1) to gain an important understanding how multiple sources of information are combined during decision making, (2) conduct new empirical tests of the fundamental process across different decision making tasks, and (3) rigorously compare among the top decision making theories based on the new empirical findings. these results will inform decision makers, allow assessment of decision making efficiency, and enable better models of choice behavior. technical description over the years, several decision making models were proposed that can account for many of the typical findings in human decision making, using both choice accuracy and response time output measures. however, no clear agreement about the underlying cognitive mechanism has been reached. these models can often be distinguished by strong implications about the processes that lead to a decision. specifically, these models imply (a) how information is searched for, (b) when this information search is stopped, and (c) how the acquired information is integrated to reach the decision. nonetheless, the disagreement remains. in part this is due to model mimicking: without appropriate experimental design and analysis, different theories can make equivalent predictions. for example, inferences based on traditional mean response time (rt) analysis are limited due to model mimicking, as different decision-making models can imply exactly the same mean response time patterns. to overcome this limitation, we will integrate the powerful systems factorial technology (sft) with traditional decision-making methods. sft has been successfully applied in a wide range of perceptual and cognitive tasks to identify processing order, stopping rule and process dependency (a, b, and c from above), but has only been applied to decision making in very limited way. our research will link sft to the classical methods in judgment and decision making to improve our understanding of the cognitive processes underlying decision-making. our project will also contribute to improving the professional academic development of undergraduate and graduate students at two state universities that traditionally have fewer research opportunities for students. all aspects of this research project, from methodology to theoretical development, will be communicated at national and international professional furthermore, the research will be submitted for publication in high-quality, peer-reviewed journals. one of the aims of the proposed research is to disseminate the findings to a broader audience through our respective university press offices"

Collaborative Research: Mapping Relational Data in Civil Conflicts,"more than half of the countries in the international system have experienced a civil war in recent decades and a growing number of countries face violent internal conflicts. the majority of civil conflicts since 1946 have had at least three active armed groups and some have had up to ten groups, yet most analyses only examine interactions between the government and an assumed homogeneous opposition group. research has fallen short in measuring and modeling techniques that adequately capture network and relational characteristics essential to the data-generating process needed for understanding civil conflict. this project unmasks the interdependent dynamics of civil conflict by conceptualizing actors and battles as a set of nodes and ties that constitute a network. the project will generate a user-friendly statistical package and website, called conflictnet, that will allow researchers to more easily conceptualize and study civil war. a growing body of literature demonstrates that controlling for interdependence in relational data yields less biased parameter estimates and allows us to better understand how conflict will evolve. conflictnet will be a valuable contribution to the field and enable scholars interested in the analysis of current political events and civil conflict in two keys ways. first, from a modeling perspective, the creation of a tool that allows for the easy generation of network data on subnational-level conflict will improve the ability to conduct inference on the drivers of civil conflict, and operationalizing conflict between armed actors using a network perspective will allow for greater accuracy in forecasting future occurrences of conflict. second, this project not only addresses critical gaps in the literature but also paves the way for new directions in intrastate conflict research: the prediction of battle-level incidents at fine-grained unit of analyses; new hypotheses on how violent events are conditional on the ebb and flow of group level characteristics, motivations, and socio-political connections; and a deeper understanding of how interdependence across armed actors escalates violence against civilians and poses new challenges for government actors."
Collaborative Research:  Measuring the Long-Term Effects of California's 2004 Paid Family Leave Statute with U.S. Tax Data,"paid family leave has been championed as a policy to reduce labor market inequality and narrow the gender gap in wage earnings. california was the first state in the nation to enact a paid family leave statute effective in july 2014, but data have limited strong conclusions about the policy's impacts. this research uses novel, large-scale internal revenue services (irs) tax data to understand how california's paid leave policy affected parents' careers and family structure over its first decade in existence. this research uses large-scale administrative irs tax data to quantify the effect of california's 2004 paid family leave statute on the short and long-term labor-market and family outcomes. the sample consists of the universe of tax-filers allowing the investigators to follow individual mothers and fathers from 2001 to 2015, link to their children's exact date of birth using data from the social security administration, and examine changes in labor market outcomes in the short-term (less than 1 year after her first birth), near term (1-5 years after birth), and long-term (6-10 years after birth). in addition, this research examines changes around first birth before the policy change took place as an internal validity check. for both mothers and fathers, the investigators provide novel evidence of how the 2004 paid family leave statute has impacted labor-force attachment, employer transitions, and wage growth. in addition, the investigators study how the statute affected family structure, including both marital stability and childbearing."
"Collaborative Research:  Women as Leaders, Policy-Makers, and Symbols","women have long been denied access to the most powerful political posts, particularly prestigious cabinet positions within the executive branch. this project examines the causes and consequences of women?s exclusion from, and appointment to, three of the most powerful cabinet posts: defense, interior/home affairs, and foreign affairs. these prominent positions policy influence and it is thus vital to explain when, why, and how women access these portfolios, as well as to understand how women?s inclusion shapes policies that are central to the functioning of the state. the central claim of this project is that women?s presence in political office shapes, and is shaped by, beliefs about the policy responsibilities of the position. though each of the portfolios studied has distinct responsibilities, they share a focus on security (i.e., protecting the state from domestic and international threats). the first set of hypotheses posits that women access the inner cabinet when the portfolios? focus expands beyond traditionally masculine policy arenas (such as terrorism and war) to emphasize issues like peacekeeping and human rights. the second set of hypotheses suggests that male and female ministers? policy priorities are largely explained by the conditions that bring women into (or keep them out of) office, rather than innate gender differences. the third set of hypotheses posits that the appointment of female ministers affects citizens? beliefs about the aims and prestige of these positions and informs their levels of trust and confidence in the minister, the ministry, and the state. this project thus advances the scientific study of women?s political representation by collecting original data to test these hypotheses. this project offers the first worldwide study of women in the inner cabinet and a framework for assessing the causes and consequences of women?s access to male-dominated posts in other realms. in doing so, the project develops a new framework for explaining when women access traditionally masculine domains and how their pathways to power affect policy outcomes and citizens? relationship to the state, we well as compiles a global database on women?s cabinet appointments and policy outputs."
Collaborative Research:  The Geography of Information: Testing the Effects of Unequal Information in the Market for Rental Housing,"there is considerable urban residential segregation in the united states by race, ethnicity, and social class, with implications for community formation and inequality, as well as school segregation. we know that the majority of urban home-seekers in the united states now use the internet as their primary source to find new places to live. despite this development, we know relatively little regarding how renters select their housing at a time when information about available housing is increasingly moving online. while this technological transformation has largely gone unexamined, some prior research shows that advertisements for rental housing are not all the same; rather, they differ systematically depending on the demographics of the neighborhood where the housing being advertised is located. this project analyzes rental housing advertisements posted online to investigate if these differences matter for people during their housing search. understanding how individuals interpret the information they see in the online housing market is key to explaining why people move to certain places and not others, which has implications for the future of residential inequality and racial/ethnic segregation. the findings will advance understanding of residential selection processes and aid policy makers looking to expand and equalize access to information for home-seekers, with implications for improved social and economic well-being in urban areas. given the role that online rental advertisement plays in promoting neighborhood composition, it is notable that we know so little regarding how individuals interpret this information. using natural language processing to analyze millions of advertisements for rental housing in the 50 largest u.s. cities posted on craigslist, prior work has identified patterns in the distribution of different types of information in neighborhoods that vary by race/ethnicity and poverty rate. this proposal will use this information to test the causal effects of these real-world differences in the ways units are advertised on individuals? housing and neighborhood preferences in five large urban areas: los angeles, sf-bay area, new york city, chicago, and houston. the project will implement three survey experiments in each area to test how online advertisements shape housing decisions and residents? perceptions of local neighborhoods. the project will compare the effects of information in housing ads and perceptions of neighborhoods to the effects of other kinds of information, including neighborhood demographic data, on individuals? interest in housing units. selection of these five large areas allows the project to oversample black, latino and asian minority respondents. each survey experiment will first be constructed to be representative of the urban area (n=1,000/area), but will then collect additional respondents from specific minority population(s) within each area: oversamples of 100-300 additional asian respondents in the sf bay area; black respondents in new york and chicago; and latino respondents (including spanish-speakers) in los angeles, chicago, and houston. by using representative surveys of specific urban areas with oversamples of minority residents, the project will analyze?through a combination of difference of means tests and multiple regression models?how reactions to housing advertisements vary across ethno-racial groups. the project will contribute to sociological theory regarding neighborhood and unit selection processes, residential sorting, the formation of place reputations, and how prospective tenants form impressions of their residential contexts. the project also will help to transform how survey experiments are developed and implemented across the social sciences by demonstrating the utility of big data sources and computational techniques."
Collaborative Research: Robust Inference for Kernel Smoothing and Related Problems,"research in economics, public policy, and other related disciplines, as well as evidence-based policy-making decisions require accurate and efficient measurements. efficient measurements require accurate, simple, and flexible statistical methods that can be easily implemented to draw conclusions from data. these methods are becoming increasingly important in the modern era of big data, high-speed computing and machine learning. new statistical methods for analyzing economic problems, including modern machine learning and similar data science approaches, are popular in economic theory because they usually offer a good compromise between flexibility and simplicity in measurement, but they are not always trusted because the results often depend on how these methods are implemented. this research will develop new methods that account for how the choices made in implementation affect the results obtained by the researcher. the proposed research offers new, modern statistical and econometric methods for analyzing large and complex data sets. these methods will produce results that do not depend on the specific details underlying how the models are implemented. this research will lead to more credible empirical findings and hence improve policy-making recommendations. this research tackles a fundamental question in the methodology of economic analyses and makes important contribution to economic science, enhancing us global leadership in economic science. the results of this research project will lead to better methods for policy research, hence enhance economic policy making. the research therefore has the potential to enhance us economic growth because of better policies. this research project focuses on a class of non- or semi-parametric estimators known as smoothed pairwise estimators, as well as generalizations thereof, and seeks to develop new large-sample approximations that produce statistical procedures that are more robust to the specifics of their implementation than existing estimators. these more general distributional approximations for smoothed pairwise estimators explicitly capture the effect of tuning parameter choices, offering improvements over standard results because they encompass findings currently available in the literature while also highlighting new features and problems previously assumed away. the research project has three main parts: (i) generalized distributional approximations for smoothed pairwise estimators, leading to both gaussian and non-gaussian limiting distributions, (ii) analytic and bootstrap-based inference methods with demonstrable superior robustness properties, and (iii) valid higher-order expansions showing formally that the proposed generalized distributional approximations and related robust inference methods give demonstrable improvements over existing methods. the results of this research project will lead to better methods for policy research, hence enhance economic policy making. the research therefore has the potential to enhance us economic growth because of better policies."
Collaborative Research: Disentangling Exploration from Exploitation,"this group of collaborative awards funds a project in economic theory. the project will develop a new approach to analyze how people make decisions between trying new experiences or continuing with long standing choices. the new approach applies to many real world situations that are not well explained with existing models. for instance, an investor might invest in one stock while gathering information on the returns to a different investment. a policymaker might explore new alternatives while implementing existing policy. an employee might search for a new job while continuing her current employment. the model applies to these situations where an individual chooses between multiple projects with unknown rewards and can invest in one to earn a reward while also observing the rewards of different projects. the new model is an alternative to a large class of models from economics and statistics that has studied a different kind of experimentation problem, often referred to as the bandit problem. in a bandit problem, the decision maker can only learn through investing. she gains information only about the project that she chooses: what she learns is linked to what she earns. the result is a well-known trade-off between exploration and exploitation: the decision - maker may desire investment in a low reward project because it offers valuable learning. the existing group of bandit models have been widely applied. the new research funded by this grant could result in deeper understanding of a similarly wide range of applications, including applications that could enhance national security and strengthen the us economy. the research team will consider three environments that offer a particularly stark contrast with the classical experimentation framework. first, when experimentation is conducted by individuals, the optimal alternative is always eventually discovered. this contrasts with the classical result of incomplete learning in classical experimentation with discounting. however, behavior is more complex than in standard experimentation environments since a simple index (such as the gittins index,which characterizes solutions in the classical framework) need not exist. second, teams composed of similar members are no longer subject to free-rider problems: when observation and exploitation are separated, teams achieve efficient experimentation. the team will also analyze questions that cannot be addressed in the standard setting. specifically, the project explores a delegation environment in which there are two agents: the executive (doer), who chooses the project to be implemented, and the intelligence agency (observer), who chooses what project to look at. because the objectives of these two agents may be misaligned, delegated choices may yield either minimal or maximal experimentation depending on the nature of contact between the doer and the observer. ultimately, the project has the potential to uncover novel features of experimentation that can be applied to various applications and tested against data."
Collaborative Research: RAPID: Socioeconomic Determinants of Social Distancing Behaviors in Response to the COVID-19 Pandemic,"the behavioral or ?social distancing? response to the covid-19 pandemic will largely determine the rate at which the virus spreads throughout the u.s. population. to encourage social distancing, many states have closed schools and nonessential businesses and instituted ?stay-at-home? orders that limit trips to necessary activities such as grocery shopping and medical care. while stay-at-home orders are typically considered mandatory, most states rely on voluntary compliance rather than penalize infractions through citations or arrests. a persistent concern throughout the crisis has been the extent to which individuals are choosing to practice social distancing effectively in order to slow the growth of the pandemic. yet, to date, virtually no systematic information has emerged on differences in social distancing across social groups by income, race/ethnicity, and residential neighborhood and, critically, why these differences exist. this project will address this gap by collecting detailed data on social distancing practices during the covid-19 pandemic ? including the timing and location of non-home trips over the course of a week ? from a sample of youth and their caregivers in the columbus, oh area. the study will build on an ongoing project focused on differences in patterns of everyday activity under normal (non-pandemic) conditions). enhanced effectiveness of social distancing holds the potential to save millions of lives, reduce the burden to inevitably taxed health care systems during pandemics, and mitigate potential longer-term damage to the us and global economies due to ineffective pandemic containment. findings from the project will provide crucial guidance to policy-makers who must target interventions to most effectively contain viral outbreaks and address the needs of the most vulnerable populations during pandemics. findings will also provide important information for epidemiologists who must model disease spread based on realistic assumptions regarding social distancing practices across the population. finally, clinicians will also benefit from more precise information on infection risk profiles at the individual level. covid-19 has prompted requirements for social-distancing, and yet we know little about who complies and who does not. this project will re-contact 246 households (n=309 youth) who participated in an ongoing nih-funded study of everyday spatial exposures that was in the field in the period prior to the onset of the covid-19 pandemic (the adolescent health and development in context study). objective 1 of the study will investigate the association between income, race/ethnicity, and residential neighborhood economic disadvantage and typical (pre-pandemic) exposure to higher infection risk locations as captured by the density of social interaction at those places. these data will shed light on infection risk during the early stages of the pandemic before social distancing behaviors were widely adopted. the study will leverage unique data from the baseline study on the geographic location and associated characteristics of everyday places visited based on a novel survey-based method for the collection of geographically-referenced activity data. objective 2 of the study will re-administer this location data collection approach during the peak period of the pandemic to measure income, race/ethnicity and neighborhood variation in the extent of social distancing behaviors for both caregivers and youth. objective 3 will address the consequences of pandemic exposure and social distancing behaviors for economic hardship, mental health, family conflict, and youth behavioral problems. the project will generate the first geographically referenced data on the mobility of youth and their caregivers during pandemics in combination with extensive, high quality social survey data. findings will inform sociological theories regarding the social and geographic determinants of compliance behavior, which complement psychological investigations more attuned to personality and individual determinants of the same."
RAPID: Collaborative Research: Adjustment and Effectiveness of Rapid Transition to Remote Work,"the covid-19 pandemic has forced much of the country?s workforce into remote work arrangements. with the need for social distancing, the ability to continue essential business functions through effective remote work arrangements is a key means for addressing the global health crisis. however, many organizations are unprepared to accommodate a remote workforce and likewise lack insight into best practices as to how to promote continued productivity and well-being of the workforce in such arrangements. although there is a large body of extant research on remote work arrangements, numerous questions remained under investigated. this project will address these gaps by studying the impact of several organizational, individual, technological, and supervisor characteristics on remote worker adjustment, well-being, and productivity. findings from the project will provide evidence-based best practices that many large and small businesses can use both during future pandemics and other extreme events, but also going forward in normal work environments that may increasingly want to support remote work. the covid-19 pandemic has suddenly promoted the need for remote work arrangements on a vast scale, but we lack key information regarding what makes such work productive and sustainable. this project will obtain data from 500 full-time employees who are working remotely during the response to covid-19 but were not doing so previously. the first phase of the project will collect a baseline survey that captures characteristics and experiences prior to the pandemic and remote work transition and general perceptions of the adjustment to remote work process. phase 2 involves a 30-day experience sampling study administered daily at the end of each workday that will capture day-to-day experiences, attitudes, and performance of remote workers. benefits of this panel design are: 1) provides insights into how multiple dynamic changes influence outcomes; 2) enhances ecological validity; 3) allows researchers to examine both within- and between-person processes; and 4) reduces retrospective recall biases. the project will partner with several work organizations to collect the data. data from phase 1 will be analyzed using regression and dominance analysis; data from phase 2 will be analyzed using multi-level modeling which controls for nested structures, adjusting standard errors to take into account the lack of independence. these analyses also control for between-subject variables and previous measurements while also accounting for missing data. findings from the project will inform organizational theories involving the effects of organizations, individuals, work, and technology on workers and work outcomes."
"RAPID: Collaborative Research: Relationships, social distancing, social media and the spread of COVID-19","this project seeks to improve the national response to the covid-19 pandemic by launching large-scale data collection through a rolling national survey linked to individual social media data. we generate information useful to policymakers and local authorities and offer near-real-time state-by-state disease tracking. our data allow officials to understand where the virus is currently spreading, facilitating improved allocation of resources. we also evaluate the networked nature of the disease, tracking its flow based on the reported social relationships of the survey participants and their social distancing behaviors. the project captures how well the information and communication needs of americans are met during this crisis, observes patterns of citizen compliance with government recommendations, stay-at-home orders, and enforced lockdowns, and assesses their impact on suppressing the spread of the virus among diverse populations. the project has two core objectives: (1) producing information that will be immediately useful in improving the national response to covid-19; and (2) using covid-19 data to understand how people adapt to and make sense of a national crisis that has important and immediate ramifications for their daily lives. we rely on a large-scale, rolling national survey that is conducted on a daily basis, with approximately 3000 respondents per day. we also link the survey data to the social media behavior of respondents. the large sample sizes collected daily offers near-real-time state-by-state disease tracking, as well as the ability to observe key differences in responses to policies across demographic groups. the design will capture how people use technology to work, get informed, and stay connected, and respondents? financial difficulties, employment experiences, and parenting and educational challenges in response to the pandemic."
RAPID: Collaborative Research: The Diffusion of State Policy Responses to the 2019 Novel Coronavirus,"when the 2019 novel coronavirus arrived in the united states in february and march of 2020, state governments quickly began enacting policies intended to contain and mitigate its spread. understanding the timing and sequence of these policy choices, and those policies? eventual consequences, is critical for assessing how governments can be most effective during pandemics. this project collects data on state and local governments? responses to covid-19, including policies related to closing schools, canceling travel, banning public gatherings, closing restaurants and bars, delaying rent payments, and rules on medical licenses. this data allows researchers to examine the factors that influence states? policy choices, whether those factors differ from the ways in which states enact policies during normal times, which policies are effective in slowing the spread and morbidity of the virus, and how states roll back policies in a manner that allows economic activity to resume while maintaining preparedness to avoid and mitigated waves of the virus. this project collects data on state government responses to covid-19 by scraping government websites daily, focusing on sites dedicated to covid-19 and those associated with the executive branch, state legislatures, and state departments of public health. it also collects data on the number of diagnosed cases, fatalities, recoveries in the states, and mobility data that tracks geographic movements from mobile phones. the policy recommendations or decisions recorded from state government pages include decisions related to closing schools, canceling travel, banning public gatherings (and their size), closing restaurants and bars, travel quarantines, postponing elections, safe shelter orders, limiting elective medical procedures, as well as when states modify these policies; additional data is collected from official state twitter accounts. this data allows researchers to examine the factors that influence states? policy choices, whether those factors differ from the ways in which states enact policies during normal times, which policies are effective in slowing the spread and morbidity of the virus, and how states roll back policies in a manner that allows economic activity to resume while maintaining preparedness to avoid and mitigated waves of the virus. this project is jointly funded by the accountable institutions and behavior program and the established program to stimulate competitive research (epscor)."
"RAPID: Collaborative Research: The Impact of COVID-19 on Norms, Risk-taking, Information, and Trust","the novel coronavirus (covid-19) has hit countries around the world hard and is likely to have both short-run and long-run impacts on health behaviors, social norms, and trust in government and other organizations. in the short run, governments and health organizations provide extensive information and recommend behavior to avoid contracting the disease and spreading it to others. this research involves surveys to figure out whether and to what extent people follow recommendations and change behavior. because the research team has been following a sample of university students for several years, the team already knows a lot about them, and this facilitates an understanding of variation in compliance with recommendations. for example, risk-tolerance and trust in organizations are likely to matter. the team is exploring how people process information about the virus, and how that affects their beliefs about the risks to themselves and others. the researchers also are examining the impact of the covid-19 outbreak on social norms, and how those change over time. the second wave of the study looks for longer run impacts. the results of this study will be useful in shaping future policies and communications about health risks, especially during epidemics and other health crises. the researchers make use of previous samples of subjects to test the impact of covid-19 information and recommendations on behavior, social norms, trust in each other and institutions, and risk-tolerance. they have four areas of study. the first is how people process ?noisy? information in the context of covid-19. prior research by a team member has shown that some individuals tend to misunderstand such information to their benefit. the teams adapt the methodology and protocol of the prior work to examine how individuals interpret covid-19 information, and how this affects their beliefs about their own vulnerabilities. second, the team studies the impact of covid-19 on norms of behavior, including those directly related to the virus (social distancing, hand-washing), as well as norms of trust, sharing and in-group favoritism that may be shifting or newly emerging in response to covid19. prior work by a team member developed a methodology for eliciting social norms, and has shown that norms evolve in response to social influence. third, they explore the impact of covid-19 on interpersonal trust and trust in institutions, which significantly impacts willingness to follow government and organizational recommendations. prior work by team members used incentivized games and surveys to study trust and reciprocity in natural disaster settings. finally, they look at risk perception and risk taking related to covid-19. using incentivized measures of risk tolerance, and survey measures of domain-specific risk perceptions and behavior, the team explores the relationship between risk aversion and behavior, but also how the advent of covid-19 has changed preferences for risk-taking. in these ways prior knowledge about the subjects provides an opportunity to study the impact of a national health catastrophe on information processing, social norms, trust and reciprocity and risk-taking."
Collaborative Research: Artificial intelligence and deep learning solution methods for dynamic economic models,"abstract artificial intelligence (ai) has many impressive applications, including self-driving cars, computer vision, and speech recognition. this project demonstrates that many challenging economic models and applications can be successfully analyzed by using the same break-ground ai technologies and the same state-of-the-art combinations of software and hardware as those used by data scientists for dealing with their impressive applications. this project develops open-source ai software that makes it possible to examine complex economic models that were intractable under the earlier solution methods. applications of this ai framework include central-banking models of monetary policy, growth models of wealth inequality, and models of social security and population aging. the developed ai tools will be disseminated in the profession by providing carefully documented replicated materials, examples and tutorials. this project consists of several components. first, the project shows how to convert three fundamental objects of economic dynamics -- lifetime reward, bellman equation and euler equation -- into objective functions suitable for deep learning. second, the project adapts the stochastic gradient descent method to maximizing the objective on few randomly drawn grid points instead of a large fixed grid used by conventional solution methods. third, the project shows how to construct the expectation operators for dynamic economic models by combining multiple expectation operators into a single unbiased expectation operator. fourth, the project automates the ai solution framework to make it ubiquitous and portable to other applications. fifth, the project solves a collection of empirically relevant applications that represent challenges to the existing solution methods in economics."
RAPID: Collaborative Research: Understanding At-Risk Adolescents' and Parents' Daily Experiences During COVID-19,"while the covid-19 pandemic has far-reaching effects on communities and individuals, its impact on at-risk youth may be particularly pervasive and distinct. this rapid project will study how at-risk adolescents and their parents experience covid-19 in the initial time period following the novel coronavirus pandemic. the research will compare adolescents? sleep, social skills, social relationship quality, stress, mood, substance use, mental health symptoms, physical health, psychosocial development, externalizing behavior, and delinquency across the covid-19 outbreak. the project also will examine whether juvenile incarceration exacerbates the potential impact of covid-19 on youth outcomes. the project will engage in a longitudinal study of at-risk (justice-involved, low-ses) adolescents to address how adolescent-parent dyads respond to and are affected by the covid-19 pandemic. this research will use multiple methods, including self-report, collateral report, official records from the partnering department of probation, electronic daily diary reports, and actigraph technology, to assess changes in adolescents? and parents? functioning on a variety of outcomes in response to the covid-19 pandemic. the findings will evince physical and mental health risks in response to the pandemic among at-risk youth. as well, the research will provide best practices for juvenile detention facilities and departments of probation in times of crises to ensure that youth continue to receive important rehabilitative services while maintaining the health and safety of youth, legal actors, and community members. results will contribute to the limited existing knowledge base on the needs, risks, and potential protective factors of a vulnerable group of youth during a global state of emergency."
RAPID: Collaborative Research: A Comparative Study of Expertise for Policy in the COVID-19 Pandemic,"as policy makers work to avert catastrophic health and economic outcomes due to covid 19, they are struggling with a difficult question: what makes expert knowledge credible, legitimate, and reliable for use in public policy? that question is especially urgent since national and regional authorities are facing scientific uncertainty and fast-moving events that cross geopolitical borders, and the need for quick action stands in tension with the need to ground policy in robust expert knowledge and convincing analysis. ways of identifying trustworthy sources of expertise is essential, but they remain largely vested in governments with their differing institutions, research traditions, cultural commitments, and civic beliefs. the pis will conduct a multi-sited investigation in ten regions that will capture detailed information about the covid 19 crisis as it unfolds, and then conduct a rigorous comparative analysis to provide a better understanding of the relationship between expertise and trust, a critically important nexus for policy makers in an era of decentralized information and polarized politics. effective dissemination of results to critical policy analysts and policy communities is key to the success of this project. to achieve this goal, the pis will utilize the extensive connections that they and their collaborative partners have to science policymakers and national and international organizations. the pis have assembled a team of research partners, well established sts scholars in ten regions, who have agreed to participate in the project. this team will collect and analyze publications and public documents pertaining to covid-19 policy making in each region. these materials will provide the basis for sts-based accounts of knowledge and policymaking in each region for the comparisons that are central to this project. to provide that account, they will build a basic policy timeline tracking key events and decisions in each region?s response to the pandemic. tracking these moves will enable them to document change and analyze variations in how issues are framed and evidence is gathered. they will also collect information on uncertainties (such as scope and limitations of scientific knowledge) and controversies, with a focus on the most contentious aspect of coronavirus policy in each region. in addition, they will track carefully chosen objects as they are incorporated into policy discussions. such objects include particularly influential epidemiological and epistemic models, widely circulated visual representations, key policy concepts, and knowledge claims about the availability, effectiveness, and future prospects of medical interventions."
"RAPID: Collaborative Research: COVID-19, Crises, and Support for the Rule of Law","the rule of law is at the foundation of modern liberal democracy. crises like the coronavirus (covid-19) pandemic, however, pose a challenge to this long-standing norm that buttresses modern democracies the world over. in the midst of a crisis, individuals' support for the rule of law is tested because their fundamental concern for the health, safety, and welfare of themselves, their families, and their friends is pitted against an abstract belief that the government ?checks all the boxes? before carrying out potentially lifesaving policies. in these situations, one?s desire for decisive government action may overwhelm, and subsequently lead to a decline in, one?s commitment to abstract democratic principles like the rule of law. consequently, evaluating how crises affect support for fundamental democratic norms is critical for understanding their impact on the health and stability of the liberal democratic order. this project leverages the covid-19 outbreak to examine this relationship and determine (a) whether governmental responses to crises affect citizens? support for the rule of law; (b) whether citizens? faith in government efforts is buttressed or undermined in response to elite and expert cues; and (c) whether citizens? attitudes change after a crisis has dissipated. each of these theoretical aims is tied to one of three unique features of the research design, which relies upon surveys of european democracies. first, to examine the effects of governmental responses, the project will collect survey data on support for the rule of law across four western democracies in april 2020: germany, spain, the united kingdom, and the united states. second, an original panel survey in germany will enable the evaluation of changes to individual-level rule of law judgments in the short, medium, and long term. lastly, embedded survey experiments will provide causal evidence on how elite and expert cues affect both the acceptance of policies and support for key aspects of the rule of law, such as compliance with laws and support for judicial constraints on executive and legislative power. findings from each part of the project will provide insights into the individual-level dynamics crises activate in citizens? relationship with democratic principles."
"Collaborative Research:  WORKSHOP:  Improving Gender Equality in Legislative Studies; Washington, DC - May 2020","representation of women in the field of legislative studies is remarkably small: the proportion of women in the legislative studies section (lss) of the american political science association (apsa) is only 22%, third from the bottom in a recent ranking of apsa sections. to solve the problem of the small numbers of women studying legislative politics, we have formed a team of scholars and developed a set of goals and implementation strategies. the first of these is the ?improving gender equality in legislative studies hackathon and collaboration workshop.? the intellectual merit of this workshop focuses on highlighting the intellectual research contributions of female scholars whose work is often obscured by their small numbers and building future research networks and collaborations among scholars whose work is myriad but sometimes siloed in the field. greater gender equality in legislative studies has broad impacts as it makes legislative politics a more attractive field of study for young scholars in the discipline, brings more diverse perspectives on legislatures to undergraduate curriculums, and produces more diverse research that is conveyed to the public through various mediums?books, articles, blog posts, editorials, news media interviews, etc. representation of women in the field of legislative studies is remarkably small: the proportion of women in the legislative studies section (lss) of the american political science association (apsa) is only 22%, third from the bottom in a recent ranking of apsa sections. to solve the problem of the small numbers of women studying legislative politics, we have formed a team of scholars and developed a set of goals and implementation strategies. the workshop will provide an opportunity for scholars of legislative politics to share current research on congress, state legislatures, and comparative legislatures, areas that are often siloed in the field rather than brought together collaboratively. it also aims to spotlight the work being done by women studying legislatures, as much of the new and different research being done in the field of legislative studies is being done by women but women?s small numbers in the field sometimes obscure their contributions. and it brings together female scholars of legislatures in all three research areas in order to encourage intellectual contributions that bridge across them."
"Collaborative Research:  Sociotechnical Imaginaries, Infrastructure Publics, and Electricity","this award supports a collaborative research effort between social science scholars from northeastern university and the university of puerto rico. the goal of the project is to compare sociotechnical imaginaries, which are imagined forms of social order that center on the development of an innovative technological project; in this case, the project of interest is the electric power system in puerto rico (an unincorporated territory of the us). the project will map over time how different imaginaries have been encoded within the material and social outlines of electric power on the island, and it will reflect on how a disastrous event, hurricane maria, served to create opportunities for different imaginaries to circulate. the results of this research will contribute to important, evolving public discussions about puerto rico's energy future. the dissemination plan includes bringing marginalized voices into the mainstream political conversations including contributing to policy briefs that address needs identified by stakeholders in the stakeholder forum. capacity-building activities will also include collaborative fieldwork between northeastern phd students and undergraduate students at the university of puerto rico, a workshop series concerning power and infrastructure development, the development of an annual residential northeastern resilience fellowship program to facilitate the exchange of ideas between scholars in puerto rico and northeastern, and an interdisciplinary on-line energy justice course co-taught by faculty at university of puerto rico and northeastern. this collaborative research project collects new data that serves to build on an existing dataset developed by the co-pis previously nsf-funded work prior to hurricane maria. the project focuses on two core objectives, to investigate how sociotechnical imaginaries of electric power were built into and evolved with the electric power system in puerto rico throughout the 20th century, and to compare different visions of energy futures before and after the devastating disruption of hurricane maria. the research team will use a mixed-methods approach that integrates archival and policy research with interviews. the results of this research will provide impactful empirical insights with relevance to decision-making, and it will provide theoretical advances for social studies of infrastructure and sociotechnical transitions. in addition, these results promise to have transformative potential to advance and link the literatures on infrastructure systems and sociotechnical transitions. they will also provide an important corrective to existing interdisciplinary social studies of the u.s. electric power system by expanding its analytic lens to consider the case of puerto rico; they will shed light on how the development of the bulk electric power system (the power grid) in the contiguous united states at once shapes and is at odds with the trajectory of electric power in puerto rico. it also presents a unique opportunity to build a comparative dataset of pre-disaster (generated through prior nsf-supported work) and post-disaster visions of transitions in the electricity sector, which will enable this project to advance and support a nuanced analysis of how disasters can support infrastructure reordering."
Collaborative Research: Student Loans and the Transition to Adulthood,"the majority of young adults now attend at least some college, and many take on substantial student debt in the process. more than two-thirds of college graduates now carry an average of around $30,000 in student debt when they finish their 4-year degrees. recently, some experts and stakeholders have discussed various plans to reduce or forgive student loans, and some colleges have begun to implement programs to reduce loans for low-income students. this project examines college students? and graduates? experiences with debt. it examines how students with loans came to take on debt, examining prior experiences with parents, advisors, and peers. it examines student attitudes towards and knowledge about debt, as well as their experiences after college as they begin to pay off that debt. the project also compares their experiences to those who attended a university that implemented a new program to reduce or eliminate student debt, comparing the experiences of those with student loan debt to those who avoided debt either because of this program or without this program. findings from the project will inform policies in higher education that aim to reduce student loan indebtedness, and provide input for families and political leaders concerned with the implications of student debt for young adults, their families and for united states society generally. student loan debt has implications for students, their families and united states society more generally. building upon an ongoing longitudinal mixed-methods study, this project will involve conducting interviews with 24 college graduates with loans at two universities who were first interviewed right before their graduation in 2016, and have been interviewed yearly since then. the project will interview this cohort in both 2020 and 2021. a new cohort of 48 seniors graduating in 2020 will be interviewed at a university that implemented a program to reduce student loans, with interviews right before and 1.5 years after graduation. the ongoing project also included surveys with 3,727 college students at two universities in 2017, as well as 173 graduating seniors from that survey again in 2018. those graduating seniors will again be surveyed in 2020. a new survey will be fielded at the university with the student loans program in 2020, with graduates of that university surveyed again in fall 2021. instrumental variable regression analyses will be combined with interview data to analyze selection into student loan debt, the different educational experiences of those with and without debt, and sentiments and knowledge about loan debt that may affect events later in young adulthood, including post-graduate experiences and outcomes. this project will help determine the impacts of student loan debt on the transition out of college and into young adulthood, and how student loan debt may represent a new ?class divide? among college graduates that produces differential outcomes later in the life course based on student loan debt status. findings will inform sociological theories of education, family formation, and transition to adulthood."

Collaborative Research: Standard Grant: The Ethics of Studying Indigenous North American Ancient DNA: Moving from Theories to Practices,"over the last decade, the study of dna from indigenous north americans who lived long ago has provided exciting insights into the evolution of diseases, migration to the americas, population dynamics, the impacts of colonization, and much more. yet, the study of ancient dna extracted from indigenous ancestors has grown so rapidly that discussions about ethical responsibilities have not kept pace with the science. the rights of living native americans are too often ignored in the study of ancient dna, even though this expanding area of research has profound social, political, psychological, and legal implications for indigenous communities. this has led to numerous controversies and problematic studies, resulting in distrust of researchers, increasing skepticism of clinical health studies in native american communities, and a looming ethical crisis for ancient dna studies. at the same time, other ancient dna initiatives based on collaboration with indigenous peoples have answered important scientific and historical questions while building mutually beneficial relationships. this study surveys and analyzes the current ethical landscape of ancient dna research and develops resources for stakeholders to enable more equitable and informed decision making and knowledge sharing. the project will also integrate diverse voices, experiences, and expertise into scientific practice and the creation of new or expanded bioethical frameworks. this project assembles and develops resources regarding the ethics of ancient dna research to support more equitable and informed decision making and responsible knowledge sharing amongst stakeholders. to do so, the project: (1) investigates the current attitudes, values, and practices of indigenous peoples and scientific communities around the ethics of ancient dna research, and (2) collaboratively develops a set of principles to guide good research practices. this project contributes to our understanding of collaborative methods in the study of dna, the ethics of managing ancestral human remains and other biological materials in museums, intellectual property issues surrounding the knowledge produced through genomics, and the human rights of indigenous peoples in relation to their genomic heritage. the outcomes of this project include a series of workshops bringing together scientific and indigenous leaders, public lectures, academic and popular publications, postdoctoral researcher mentorship, and the website adnaethics.org, which will present ""good practices"" and online resource kits that can be used across university classrooms, museums, ethics review committees, indigenous cultural preservation offices, journals, labs, and beyond."
Collaborative Research: Empowering Open Law and Science,"research transparency provides immense value across all areas of scholarly inquiry by helping to reveal the rigor, reliability, and relevance of, and to make more evaluable, all types of research. scholars who engage in qualitative inquiry sometimes find it difficult to make their work transparent, i.e. to clearly communicate the meticulous and systematic research procedures and practices that they employ to generate and analyze qualitative data, and to clearly portray the evidentiary value of those data. annotation for transparent inquiry (ati), an emerging approach to increasing the transparency of published qualitative and multi-method social science, helps to address those challenges. this project aims to develop and test a new software tool that will empower scholars to use ati to reveal the procedures they followed to generate data, explicate the logic of their analysis, and directly link to underlying data such as interviews or archival documents. the tool will thus help researchers and the public to better understand and evaluate qualitative research and provide easier access to the rich data underlying such work. the partnership between researchers, academic data repositories, and creators of open-source software that the project represents should make a significant contribution to infrastructure for research and education. the project also encourages intellectual democratization, enhancing access to transparency practices, to key insights and findings in social science and legal scholarship, and to research data. ati empowers authors to annotate their publications using interoperable web-based annotations that add valuable details about their work?s evidentiary basis and analysis, excerpts from data sources that underlie claims, and potentially links to the data sources themselves. the prototype for a new open-source tool that the project will develop will allow scholars to restructure, edit and package annotations (anno-rep). anno-rep will empower scholars to create and curate web-based annotations at any point in the writing process; signal their motivation; and publish those annotations on a web page in tandem with the scholarly work that they accompany. these innovations will significantly ease the use of ati and facilitate and encourage its seamless integration into the writing and publishing processes, promoting scientific progress through qualitative inquiry. the project will solicit feedback for anno-rep?s continued development from ten scholars with familiarity with ati, and will also evaluate the tool through a workshop including 20 legal scholars (faculty and graduate students). in order to promote the use and hasten the scholarly adoption of both ati and anno-rep, the project will encourage and help scholars to propose work that has been annotated using ati and anno-rep for presentation at disciplinary conferences. in addition, it will organize a symposium of articles that use, and analyze the use of, ati for submission to, review by, and publication in a top legal journal."
Collaborative Research: The Geography of Information: Testing the Effects of Unequal Information in the Market for Rental Housing,"there is considerable urban residential segregation in the united states by race, ethnicity, and social class, with implications for community formation and inequality, as well as school segregation. we know that the majority of urban home-seekers in the united states now use the internet as their primary source to find new places to live. despite this development, we know relatively little regarding how renters select their housing at a time when information about available housing is increasingly moving online. while this technological transformation has largely gone unexamined, some prior research shows that advertisements for rental housing are not all the same; rather, they differ systematically depending on the demographics of the neighborhood where the housing being advertised is located. this project analyzes rental housing advertisements posted online to investigate if these differences matter for people during their housing search. understanding how individuals interpret the information they see in the online housing market is key to explaining why people move to certain places and not others, which has implications for the future of residential inequality and racial/ethnic segregation. the findings will advance understanding of residential selection processes and aid policy makers looking to expand and equalize access to information for home-seekers, with implications for improved social and economic well-being in urban areas. given the role that online rental advertisement plays in promoting neighborhood composition, it is notable that we know so little regarding how individuals interpret this information. using natural language processing to analyze millions of advertisements for rental housing in the 50 largest u.s. cities posted on craigslist, prior work has identified patterns in the distribution of different types of information in neighborhoods that vary by race/ethnicity and poverty rate. this proposal will use this information to test the causal effects of these real-world differences in the ways units are advertised on individuals? housing and neighborhood preferences in five large urban areas: los angeles, sf-bay area, new york city, chicago, and houston. the project will implement three survey experiments in each area to test how online advertisements shape housing decisions and residents? perceptions of local neighborhoods. the project will compare the effects of information in housing ads and perceptions of neighborhoods to the effects of other kinds of information, including neighborhood demographic data, on individuals? interest in housing units. selection of these five large areas allows the project to oversample black, latino and asian minority respondents. each survey experiment will first be constructed to be representative of the urban area (n=1,000/area), but will then collect additional respondents from specific minority population(s) within each area: oversamples of 100-300 additional asian respondents in the sf bay area; black respondents in new york and chicago; and latino respondents (including spanish-speakers) in los angeles, chicago, and houston. by using representative surveys of specific urban areas with oversamples of minority residents, the project will analyze?through a combination of difference of means tests and multiple regression models?how reactions to housing advertisements vary across ethno-racial groups. the project will contribute to sociological theory regarding neighborhood and unit selection processes, residential sorting, the formation of place reputations, and how prospective tenants form impressions of their residential contexts. the project also will help to transform how survey experiments are developed and implemented across the social sciences by demonstrating the utility of big data sources and computational techniques."
Collaborative Research: FW-HTF-RM: Augmentation for Tomorrow: Expanding the Future Capacities of Independent Workers,"technological advancements are changing how people work, what they are able to accomplish, and what they imagine to be possible. one aim of these advancements has long been to augment workers' capacities. however, these efforts have often focused narrowly on improving productivity and safety rather than enhancing personal well-being or creativity. this research promotes the idea that technology--if well designed--can support workers' needs holistically, and only in embracing this approach can we design sustainable human/technology partnerships for the future. the investigators will collaborate with independent knowledge workers in domains such as media, law, and scholarship, who are not full-time employees in traditional organizations. these workers often enjoy the freedom to organize their work relative to a variety of factors. however, as part of this freedom, they often feel pressure to effectively manage tasks, time, clients, collaborators, finances, reputations, and multiple non-professional aspects of their lives on their own. by attending to how this population integrates work, family, home, volunteer responsibilities, and other pursuits into their daily lives, this research will provide design inspiration for ensuring a more humane work experience in the future and inform related policy, infrastructure, and training discussions. the researchers will observe a sample of independent knowledge workers in their professional environments (equally distributed on the west coast and east coast). each worker will be interviewed before and after each observation. collected data will be analyzed in collaboration with a third member of the research team, a design researcher, who will conduct a debrief session after each observation with the requisite investigator to elicit additional insights from the field. the data will be processed to create a series of design workbooks that will be used to support joint data analysis, identify data gaps, and generate inputs for the final year of the study. during this period, the research team will conduct participatory design workshops with the independent workers who participated in the earlier phase of the study. the investigators will also disseminate information about how human/technology partnerships can be reimagined to support a more expansive understanding of the future of work."
Collaborative Research: FW-HTF-RM: Intelligent Facilitation for Teams of the Future via Longitudinal Sensing in Context,"in the information workplace of the future, teamwork will become increasingly critical and teamwork itself will be redefined. teams will need to develop better skills in handling complex problems as routine work will be increasingly delegated to artificial intelligence (ai) technologies such as personal digital assistants. teams will need to rapidly adapt to fluid membership and changing work structures with the growing gig economy, and as new workers enter the workforce bringing new cultural practices. individuals will need to be able to perform effectively in heterogeneous teams as the workforce becomes more diverse and as globalization increases. the future of teamwork will require integration of technological advances to facilitate team performance, yet we are largely relying on tools and techniques from the 20th century for team facilitation. this project will develop and validate an intelligent (ai-based) team facilitator for information work utilizing sensing and dynamic intervention to promote better team coordination, higher performance, and ultimately lower worker burnout. the intelligent team facilitator will serve as a blueprint for a broad set of domains beyond information work, including medical care teams, control room settings, crisis management, and manufacturing, where team skills will be needed for interacting with ai, robots, and new technologies. the facilitator can also be used for training underrepresented groups to succeed in the workforce, a national priority. the present project utilizes sensor technologies for tracking team behavior in information workplaces in addition to traditional methods of studying teams using observations and self- reports. longitudinal precision tracking of teams in situ with a suite of sensors can provide objective measures, can scale, and will enable a deep understanding of how teams respond to changing contexts, how teams form and integrate new members, and how they develop rhythms of teamwork. this project examines team diversity broadly, considering demographics, attitudes, circadian rhythms and personal responsibilities. the first aim of this project is to develop models of critical team states and processes (e.g., team cohesion, team coordination, team mood/affect), based on unobtrusive, continual, longitudinal sensing of physiology, behavior, and communication in a real-world context along with measures of individual differences to understand factors that lead to team effectiveness. this project will use risk mitigation strategies to safeguard privacy and security of data. the second aim of this project is to use those insights to develop an intelligent (ai-based) team facilitator. performance of teams who use the intelligent team facilitator will be experimentally compared against matched controls in a longitudinal in situ study. the results will contribute to a new understanding on how 21st century teams can manage complexity, how team heterogeneity can lead to team effectiveness, and will identify successful strategies for team adaptability."
"Collaborative Research: Multi-distribution, Multivariate, and Multiscale Spatio-Temporal Models with Applications to Official Statistics","this research project will develop statistical methodology for complex spatio-temporal data. the project is motivated by common features found in many modern federal datasets such as the u.s. census bureau's american community survey (acs) and the longitudinal employer household dynamics (lehd) program. the public-use acs and lehd datasets are enormous and have an overwhelming amount of information on many different demographic and economic indicators, at different u.s. regions and different time periods. this project will develop statistical methods that are tailored to these types of federal data. the project will advance knowledge within the statistical sciences, and the results of this research will be of value to the work of government agencies. because many subject-matter disciplines, such as neuroscience, demography, and econometrics, also deal with complex data, the results of this research will be broadly useful. software packages will be developed and made publicly available. the investigators will educate and train both graduate and undergraduate students. using a hierarchical approach, this research project will develop bayesian methodologies for computationally efficient statistical models for dependent multi-distributional and multiscale (in space and time) spatio-temporal data. the project has three aims. in aim 1, the investigators will develop distribution theory that allows for computationally efficient analysis of high-dimensional datasets that consist of data from multiple distributions, such as gaussian data, counts, and bernoulli data. in aim 2, the investigators will develop approaches to small-area estimation in the high-dimensional, multi-distributional, and multivariate spatio-temporal data setting. in aim 3, the investigators will develop approaches to mitigate aggregation error in the high-dimensional, multi-distributional, and multiscale spatio-temporal data setting. the methodologies developed in the project will use basis functions and spatial change of support to facilitate dimension reduction and to aid in computation. this project also will make use of vector auto-regressive models, the karhunen-loeve expansion, and conjugate multivariate distribution theory to develop principled methodologies that are useful for both the scientific and federal communities."
GCR: Collaborative Research: The Future of Quantitative Research in Social Science,"this growing convergence research project aims to develop algorithms and tools to better use social media data and other new forms of publicly available text data to advance understanding of human behavior and society. the research team will integrate across the social, behavioral, and computer sciences to create and adapt computer algorithms and data mining methods in ways that adhere to the design structures, measurement rigor and ethical protections of social science. while much research is emerging in this space, no established best practices exist for designing proper micro- and macro-level studies involving social media and other open-source text data. the research team, representing the breadth of behavioral/social science and computer science, will develop and test methodologies for sampling, validating, and analyzing social media data so that social scientists can easily interpret and generalize from them. specifically, this project will (1) develop a detailed, hybrid methodology (iterative method for social media research - imsmr) that integrates relevant components of existing social science methodologies with relevant components of the knowledge discovery process to enhance research practices in both social and computer science fields; (2) use imsmr to establish guidelines for using an array of different social media data to answer questions across different social and data science disciplines; (3) test and refine the methodology and guidelines on different research exemplars that spans multiple social, behavioral, and economic disciplines; and (4) develop a shared text analytic research portal that enables social scientists to generate structured variables using state of the art natural language processing and data mining that adhere to the validity and reliability standards of social science."
Collaborative Research: The Impacts of Racial Discrimination on Housing Choice and Economic Well-Being in the United States,"this award funds research on how renters choose where to live. the choice of residential location is a critical economic decision for households in the united states. renters search for housing that best meets their needs given their budget. this includes considering affordability, the specifics of the apartment or house as well as desired neighborhood features. however, some renters may face discrimination from landlords and property managers. housing market discrimination could steer renters into specific neighborhoods and distort the housing search process. this project seeks to understand how possible discrimination affects the search process. the team will conduct an innovative field experiment to see how discrimination affects housing searchers. the team will use the results to develop estimates of the social costs of discrimination in rental housing markets. the project will yield new insights to improve fair housing policy. experimental research on discrimination on housing markets has ignored the role of housing search, making it difficult to disentangle the effect of discrimination behavior on household sorting from the effects of location characteristics. this project integrates a field experiment with an online rental housing platform with a welfare-theoretic framework that takes housing search into account. the field experiment will make use of an innovative use of supercomputing infrastructure to send inquiries to rental housing listings. by examining how landlords and property managers respond to rental inquiries, they will be able to evaluate the impacts of possible discrimination on the choice sets faced by some renters. the welfare-theoretic approach accounts for impacts of discrimination on multiple neighborhood characteristics. it is currently unclear whether discrimination disproportionately hinders the location decisions of households who have preferences for certain attributes of housing or neighborhoods: affordable housing, school quality, safe neighborhoods, or harmful pollution exposures. this project will examine whether certain types of renters are disproportionately affected by discriminatory behavior in the housing market. finally, the project will give us more accurate estimates of the lost social welfare from housing discrimination."
Collaborative Research: Evidence in Economic Models,"this award funds research in economic theory. the team will study the acquisition and use of hard information or evidence which enables interested parties to prove some assertions they wish to make. when can social institutions be designed in such a way as to provide strong enough incentives to interested parties to acquire enough sufficiently credible evidence as to enable efficient outcomes? when efficiency is not possible, what is the nature of the distortions from efficiency generated by the best institutions that are possible? the research team will develop mathematical models for studying these questions, including tools for making the analysis sufficiently tractable to yield clear results. more broadly, the work will facilitate research of applied economic models in this large class of interesting environments. by providing tools for making the analysis more tractable, the research may generate new classes of economic institutions and shed new light on existing ones. the tools will also be useful in studying the structure of organizations, such as firms and governments. the project focuses on mechanism design when agents can acquire noisy evidence. the general model has connections to a wide range of economic models of ""hard information"", such as bayesian persuasion and models of testing. the team will develop tools for simplifying the mechanism design problem to be able to focus on a more tractable class of mechanisms. in particular, they will develop conditions under which one can identify the evidence the principal will request given any claim by the agent and/or the evidence generation actions the principal will recommend given any type report. together or separately, this identification will greatly simplify characterization of the optimal mechanism. the investigators will also compare optimal mechanisms to outcomes when the principal cannot commit himself. finally, they will characterize environments in which efficient outcomes are possible and the nature of distortions when efficiency is not achievable."
RIDIR: Collaborative Research: Bayesian analytical tools to improve survey estimates for subpopulations and small areas,"in this project, a set of tools will be built for in-depth analysis of survey data, making use of and extending statistical methods for estimation for small subgroups. classical methods for surveys are focused on aggregate population-level estimates but we can learn much more using small-area estimation. the goal of this project is to build a user-accessible platform for modeling and visualizing survey data that would give estimates for arbitrary subgroups of the population, along with visualization tools to display estimates of interest. the model would be fit in stan, a state-of-the-art open-source platform for bayesian inference, and implemented for the cooperative congressional election survey (cces). an example of the sort of analysis that could be performed using these methods is a study of how demographic gaps in voting vary by age, education, and state. the statistical method of multilevel regression and poststratification (mrp) allows inferences for narrow slices of the population. in the terminology of survey methods, mrp is ""model-based"" in that it uses regression to do partial pooling (smoothing) for small areas and demographic slices, and it is ""design-based"" in adjusting for variables such as age, sex, ethnicity, and education that are predictive of inclusion in the sample. one reason for extracting inferences for population subgroups using a flexible tool rather than one-time analyses is that key variables can change over time. multilevel modeling gives the flexibility to adjust for large numbers of predictors, which makes poststratification more effective. as a bonus, this modeling and adjustment enables extraction of estimates of average survey responses for small slices of the population, which can correspond to the very sorts of inferences that consumers particularly want, and which typically are unavailable from surveys without huge sample sizes."
Collaborative Research: The Multistage Path to Peace in Civil Conflicts,"civil conflicts are critically important to the international community due to the fact that the consequences of those conflicts often spill across state borders, such as through refugee flows and weapons movements. yet we understand relatively little about the process of negotiating peace in civil wars. the goal of this project is to better understand the process of negotiating peace agreements to end civil conflicts. to that end, it analyzes the multiple stages of the peace process: initiation (negotiation offers), pre-bargaining (agreeing to negotiate), negotiations (reaching an agreement), and implementation (ending the conflict). understanding each stage is important because there are often multiple starts and stops throughout the peace process. with so many killed and displaced by civil conflicts around the world, understanding the particularities of this multi-stage process, and how the actions of international actors can facilitate (or may actually hamper) the process, is of critical importance for international peace and security. this project studies the complexities of the peace process, can enable international actors to be more effective in their efforts to end civil conflicts. while there are several studies on the outcomes of civil conflicts, as well as characteristics of the peace agreements that sometimes end them, there is a dearth of knowledge about the process itself: when and why warring parties will choose to move forward through its multiple stages and when and why they might withdraw from the process. to fill this gap, the principle investigators are drawing on primary and secondary documentation to create a comprehensive dataset on peace negotiations in civil conflicts from 1945-2016. primary sources include un and other international organization documents and signed peace agreements. secondary sources include historical accounts of civil conflicts around the world. the dataset codes each stage of the negotiation process (negotiation, agreement, and implementation). if a breakdown occurred at any stage, the dataset includes detailed information on which of the parties (government or rebel group) refused to move forward in the peace process (refused to negotiate, walked away from negotiations, or failed to implement the agreement). third-party actions such as mediation or military, economic, or diplomatic intervention will also be collected. this new dataset will allow the principle investigators to conduct a detailed, quantitative investigation of the peace process as it played out across a wide variety of civil conflicts, and the conditions under which successes or breakdowns occurred at the various stages. the principal investigators will also address the non-random selection of belligerents into later stages of the peace process through a variety of statistical methods. the findings illuminate how governments and rebel groups can navigate the peace process in civil conflicts successfully and what role third party actors play in facilitating that process."

Collaborative Research: Financial Network Reactions to Regulations and Interventions,"abstract the role of government interventions and regulations in the operation of the financial sector has important implications for the economy. this project explores how banking regulations and government interventions affect the interaction of banks. the project uses historical and modern data sources to analyze the changes in interbank relations in changing regulatory policy environments. the project considers that a banking network adjusts to the anticipation of government support in ways that makes the banking system more reliant on government support and more prone to less likely catastrophic events. second, the project looks at the effects of opacity versus transparency by considering that banks operating with opacity support each other at times of distress without disturbing the broader economy and creating panics. finally, the research looks at the implications of central clearing counterparties. central clearing counterparties (ccp) are institutions that take counterparty risk to transactions and provide clearing and settlement services for them. this research explores how central clearing of derivatives enhances coordination among banks and prevents crises which can arise as coordination failures on clearing obligations. this project explores several research questions on the banking system and central clearing policies. first question explores how public liquidity provision affects the way banks relate to each other. the project constructs a theory on the effects of the public liquidity provisions by the federal reserve system (fed) and test the predictions of this theory utilizing historical data on the establishment of the fed in 1913. this research indicates that public liquidity provision by the fed indirectly creates the first shadow banking sector in the u.s., so that an unexpected contraction in public liquidity can induce systemic risk. second research question explores recent regulations that mandate central clearing of derivatives and how these regulations affect the exposure and interconnections of different banks. this research constructs a theoretical model of derivatives which highlights a tradeoff. on the one hand, ccps have the benefit of enhancing coordination across banks. on the other hand, ccps operate partly as an exchange that improves market transparency, reducing bank insurance. using detailed data that includes exposures of all banks in the u.s. to all other financial and non-financial institutions, this research explores how these tradeoffs interact in different layers of the banking network."
"Collaborative Research: The Influences of Market Power, Mergers, and Provider Incentives on the Cost and Quality of Healthcare: The Case of Dialysis","this award funds research in how competition between firms affects both the price and quality of a key health care service. the pis will investigate how changes in the dialysis industry affects firm strategies, medicare costs, and patient outcomes. the project will use a very large data set to test hypothesis drawn from the economic theory of firm competition. the research has three distinct components. the first part focuses on how mergers and acquisitions affect firm strategy in this industry and the consequences for patient outcomes. the second component evaluates how regulations that affect the construction of new facilities influence market structure as well as patient outcomes. the third part analyzes a payment reform instituted by medicare that reduced the incentives to over-prescribe injectable drugs, which again may have affected both medicare's costs and patient's outcomes. understanding the market for dialysis services is important for several reasons. dialysis is an important component of health insurance costs; medicare's annual total reimbursements for dialysis amount to about 1% of the entire federal budget. high quality dialysis care improves patients' lives. finally, understanding how changes in competition and in medicare policies have affected the dialysis market will give us new knowledge about how robust competition and sensible regulation and medicare reimbursement policies may be able to reduce costs and improve patient outcomes. the research team will use claims data from the entire universe of u.s. dialysis patients between 1998 and 2014; during this time period the industry became more concentrated. the projects funded by this award look at three different aspects of consolidation in the dialysis industry. the first studies how large dialysis chains have transferred their corporate strategies to the numerous independent facilities they acquired, which ultimately can affect the cost and quality of their treatments. the second develops a structural model of dialysis firms' entry, exit, and acquisition decisions to (i) understand how market structure and regulation affect dialysis care and (ii) estimate the impact of counterfactual policies, such as blocking mergers or relaxing certificate of need laws. the third examines how medicare's reimbursement policies shape dialysis facilities' behavior, focusing specifically on a reform in 2011 that changed medicare's reimbursement scheme for injectable drugs from a per-dose payment to a bundled payment. the team will use a novel instrumental variable strategy to provide the first causal evidence in the literature about whether the bundled payment policy resulted in lower drug doses, reduced costs and improved outcomes. the project advances the economics literature on market power, merger analysis, and provider incentives in health care."
Collaborative Research: An Interdisciplinary Approach to Predicting Unequal Treatment,"disparities in outcomes across social groups are found in nearly every domain of modern human society, including education, the labor market, and healthcare. whether on the basis of gender, ethnicity, age or other markers, group-based differences in how people treat others are known to arise even when social group information is irrelevant and even when people explicitly reject social stereotypes. despite progress in documenting these disparities, much remains unknown about their origins. the current research focuses on the role of individual human decision-making in producing societal-level outcomes. specifically, the investigators aim to leverage complementary strengths of behavioral economics, social psychology, and cognitive neuroscience to uncover systematic patterns of individual human decision-making that, in aggregate, contribute to societal treatment disparities. the primary goal is to characterize the origins of unequal treatment with sufficient precision to support accurate, context-specific predictions of how people will treat members of different social groups. support for this collaborative effort broadens access to training opportunities for aspiring scientists, provides opportunities for scientific outreach to local communities, and ultimately contributes scientific understanding of societal disparities, with implications for efforts to measure and address discrimination. substantial progress has been made in documenting the existence of treatment disparities in the world. separately, substantial progress has been made in in understanding how people think about different social groups in the laboratory. however, given the multitude of ways in which people can be categorized, and the complexity of factors influencing people's social behavior, it has been challenging to construct models of social thought and behavior that are capable of linking laboratory insights to field observations. the current research aims to connect these efforts to produce accurate predictions about when and how members of particular groups will be (dis)advantaged. specifically, building upon evidence from cognitive neuroscience that valuation and social cognition engage separable but interacting systems, the research uses computational modeling to formally integrate psychological frameworks of how people see others (social perception) with behavioral economic accounts of how people value others' outcomes (social valuation). it then uses those models to predict how people will treat members of different social groups in laboratory and field settings."
"Collaborative Research: Skills, Majors, and Jobs: Does Higher Education Respond?","rapid technical progress leads to skill obsolescence, yet educational institutions and students are slow to respond to these changes in the labor market. this research project will use a large data set on changes in skill demand and college enrolments by major and the content of majors to investigate two interrelated questions: (i) what skills are associated with each college major and how does skill demand vary over time and space? (ii) how do higher education course-offerings and student course-taking respond to changes in demand for skills? the research will be based on data on all job postings over a time matched with data on all course offering (and their content) in a state. the results can help institutions respond to skill demand by rapidly changing the content of their curricula and educational policy makers plan better. the results will also help guide students not only in their choice of majors but also the courses and skills they choose to acquire in their chosen majors. by providing inputs into policies that align skill needs and skill training in a rapidly changing technological work place, this research will help us educational institutions provide the skills the economy needs, hence lead to rapid economic growth and improved well-being of americans. this project will use merged data from the burning glass project and the delaware cost project which has department level panel data on credits, courses and faculty as well as individual level data on student course taking, quasi-experimental methods and machine learning techniques to investigate how college students and college administration respond to changes in labor skill demand. specifically, it investigates what skills are associated with each college major, how within major cross-major skills demand differ across space and through time, and how skill investment responds to changes in skill demand in the labor market. previous studies have focused on the demand side of skill acquisition; this project will however look at how skill supply (by university providers and students) respond to changes in skill demand by exploring several aspects university curriculum that makes these supply responses possible. the quasi-experimental methods permit causal identification of the effect of changes in skill demand on human capital investment. the project will explore differential responses at lower-division, upper-division, and graduate levels. the results of this research will provide guidance on policies to align skill investment to changes in skill demand and in so doing will provide the needed skills and lead to faster economic growth."
Collaborative Research: Standard: Exploring how scientists on multidisciplinary laboratory teams negotiate expertise and claim legitimacy regarding ethical practice.,"the increasing diversity and complexity characterizing today's engineering workforce and practice requires new research on the social factors that shape ethics in stem work. a common approach in research and teaching is to incorporate the social aspects of teamwork, diversity, and ethics into isolated lectures, separate courses, or to treat them as outcome variables. however, this project takes the perspective that ethics is interwoven into everyday stem work not as a static outcome variable, but rather as a communication-based achievement enacted in the social processes through which stem work is organized. it tests the hypothesis that in addition to technical, process, or industry expertise, stem team members can cultivate ethical expertise, a form of knowledge and skills informing appropriate ways of working that is developed through situated experience. this research advances scientific knowledge by systematically investigating if and how different patterns of communication affect ethical climates and ethical behavior within vertically integrated multidisciplinary stem teams from national and university laboratories. it identifies areas in which misperceptions or misapplication of expertise may act as a barrier to the development of ethical cultures in stem organizations and explores the ways ethics are learned and shared through ongoing social relationships and interactions. identifying the social and communicative factors impacting the ethical accomplishment of complex scientific work provides insight into a variety of actions and policies that universities, national labs, and industry partners can use to cultivate ethical and collaborative research climates to aid in the discovery and application of scientific knowledge. the study combines interview and ethnographic data with social network analysis to examine how different patterns of communication and interaction among members of stem teams affect their perceptions of ethics in laboratories and how these perceptions impact ethical research climates and the social structures that enable effective and ethical teamwork. phase 1 utilizes ethnographic methods and grounded thematic analysis of interviews and observations to capture and investigate the everyday practice of participants. phase 2 builds upon these findings and employs social network analysis to assess the interdependent relationships between the different forms of expertise present in the development of ethical climates, and their relationship to ongoing interactions among team members. phase 3 integrates these findings and maps them onto extant literature to compare the salient features of each institution and determine the explanatory mechanisms for the cultivation of ethical climates and ethical behavior in stem teams."
FW-HTF-RM: Collaborative Research: Understanding the Algorithmic Workplace: A Multi-Method Study for Comprehensive Optimization of Platforms,"the emergence of the digital platform economy in recent years is rapidly transforming some kinds of economic activity. this project will develop new evidence about the workers, business organizations, and government institutions that are involved in the ""algorithmic workplace"" or ""gig economy"". the research team includes experts in social science, public policy, and engineering. the team will conduct research to document the experiences, attitudes, and needs of platform workers. they will use these findings to build a mathematical model of worker behavior that will be combined with business data from an industrial partner. the result will be a model that can predict how changes in business operations will affect worker outcomes. the team will use field experiments to test the model predictions. the results of this project will be new knowledge for businesses that need to retain and motivate their workforce, new evidence for policymakers that seek to understand how neighborhoods and communities are affected by the growth of platform work, and new empirical evidence about the benefits and risks of platform work for the us workforce. the team will undertake an interdisciplinary program of research aimed at generating theoretical and practical knowledge of issues that result from the advent of the algorithmic workplace in the united states. the project begins by conducting research on the attitudinal and behavioral characteristics of platform workers. interviews and surveys will shed light on the occupational trajectories, experiences of risk, and regulatory preferences found among workers on several types of labor platforms. the team will analyze the qualitative data to shed new light over ongoing debates about the nature of algorithmic control of workers, the labor market dynamics which the platform economy fosters, and the policy preferences of workers themselves. a mathematical framework of worker behavior will be designed to model the fusion of these coded qualitative data with internal data from deliv, a digital platform for package delivery. this will lead to a novel contribution of this project: agent-based modeling that can simulate the action of platform workers as they respond to shifts in the design of the algorithms on which platforms rely. this second stage of the research will be used to provide a deeper and better informed understanding of the strategies which workers employ as they respond to the technological changes programmers introduce in their efforts to refine the algorithms governing transactions made possible by platforms."
Collaborative Research: Understanding Migration and Fertility,"this project investigates the question of whether migrant women's fertility reflects high desired family sizes or difficulties regulating fertility due to high cost, lack of knowledge about services, and other obstacles. society's most vulnerable women often face great challenges with fertility regulation. this may be particularly true of international migrant women who often lack healthcare access, social networks, and/or financial resources that might be important for fertility regulation. in this study, the association between migration and fertility, family planning use, fertility preferences, and difficulties regulating fertility is investigated by comparing international migrants to women in their countries of origin who have similar background characteristics but did not migrate. findings will expand knowledge concerning population change and will have the potential to inform outreach strategies and public health campaigns that reduce unintended outcomes. this project explores the association between international migration and fertility by combining data from both sending and receiving countries using a propensity score matching approach. to date, most studies have been limited to the use of data sources collected primarily in receiving countries and have typically compared migrants to native-born residents of the receiving country, rather than to residents of their country of origin with whom they share a common background. in contrast, our project integrates cross-sectional data from two surveys to create a novel data set that allows for matching highly similar respondents who did and did not migrate from sending countries to a receiving country. this enables: (1) investigation of the association between international migration and fertility by comparing migrants in receiving countries to similar non-migrants in sending countries; and (2) exploration of the association between international migration and underlying reproductive desires and behaviors that could help explain why migration is associated with fertility."
Collaborative Research: RUI: Standard Grant: Artificial Intelligence and Predictive Policing: An Ethical Analysis,"this project is a study of the use of artificial intelligence to assist police on patrol by using massive troves of historical crime data to train machine learning algorithms to anticipate the timing and location of criminal activity. predictive policing has come under intense criticisms from civil rights groups, academics, and communities that have been subject to predictive policing. these criticisms include its recapitulation of racially biased patterns of policing, its further burdening of marginalized communities, and its infringement on the liberties of targeted communities. the researchers propose to examine these claims and to develop best practices for the development and deployment of algorithmic policing programs. the results of this project promise to benefit police departments, communities patrolled based on algorithmic crime predictions, and public understanding of the societal and ethical implications of predictive policing. the aims of this grant are to examine and develop viable ethical frameworks for the assessment of predictive policing practices. in doing so, the researchers will propose and evaluate novel considerations that might bear on the ethics of predictive policing. they will also develop empirically grounded recommendations for the ethically sensitive and effective development and use of predictive policing. the results of this project promise to advance understanding and illuminate fertile new areas of research in moral philosophy, technology ethics, sociology, and criminology. they also will have clear relevance for other algorithmic technologies with similar implications for justice including algorithms that predict criminal sentences, make healthcare diagnoses, and serve as gatekeepers to government benefits (all of which are currently in use)."
Collaborative Research: Social Construction of Legal Exclusion in Slums,"this project investigates how legal exclusion is socially constructed in legally recognized vs. non-recognized slum settlements. extensive research has demonstrated that residents of slum settlements globally have considerably worse outcomes on key social indicators, including poverty, employment conditions, and exposure to violence, than formally housed urban populations. despite the recognition that legal status has significant impacts on the socioeconomic conditions of slum residents, little is known about why governments withhold official recognition and deny access to life-supporting infrastructure and residential security for slum residents. this research investigates how legal exclusion is constructed--as a political and bureaucratic entity, as a geographic and social reality, and as individual lived experience. it is also designed to explain how conditions vary in communities with different degrees of legal recognition and access. the project's three research aims are to identify the multi-level factors that produce the legal exclusion experienced by residents of non-recognized slums; demonstrate how legal exclusion is experienced as both a collective and individual level phenomenon that shapes the wellbeing of slum residents; and disentangle the effects of legal exclusions from other, more widely studied aspects of informal settlements, by comparing slum settlements with different administrative and legal contexts. the multi-level research design builds on insights from ethnographic research on social exclusion and political action in slums showing that legal exclusion is not only produced at the macro-level through policy and public discourse, but also at the community-level through negotiations with local administrators, police officers, and service delivery workers; and at the micro-level within the inner lives and subjective experiences of slum residents. this approach is rooted in longstanding efforts in sociology to integrate macro theories of social structure with micro-level analyses of social action to explain collective and individual outcomes."
Collaborative Research:  Uncovering and Utilizing the Dynamic Interplay between Work Recovery and Resilience,"all employees will, at some point, encounter workplace adversities such as work overload, role ambiguity, interpersonal conflict, abusive supervision, or work-family conflict. thus, there is a critical need to identify pathways through which employees can achieve work effectiveness and wellbeing, despite facing difficulties. work resilience -- positive adaptation despite adversity at work -- is an advantageous tool that offers a path to success despite adverse experiences. we propose one unexplored way to increase resilience is through recovery, in which non-work time is used to recuperate from fatigue and negative mood built up during the work day. this project's goal is to understand how psychological (e.g., detachment from work, relaxation) and physical (e.g., sleep, exercise) recovery experiences relate to work resilience. determining behaviors that improve resilience which are under individuals' control during their non-work time has the potential to benefit individuals, teams, and organizations across every occupation. the goal of this project is to uncover and model the dynamic interrelationship of psychological and physical work recovery experiences with work resilience. this project: 1) assesses potential psychological (fatigue) and physiological (heart rate variability) mechanisms that link work recovery and resilience; 2) examines the differential effects of alternative work recovery experiences (i.e., psychological and physical) on work resilience; and 3) delineates the temporal dynamics between work recovery and resilience, uncovering potential cumulative and reciprocal effects. we will conduct two experience sampling research studies using (a) a sample of traditionally employed participants who work during standard weekly business hours and (b) a sample of shift workers - employees who work alternative shifts that at least partially fall outside the daytime shift range (e.g., night shift and rotating shift employees) - to test the current model. each study is a four-week daily survey study in a sample of 100 working adults that incorporates both objective behavioral and physiological indicators. by explicating the relative importance of different recovery experiences contributing to work resilience and the dynamic relationship between work recovery and resilience, this project could provide a theoretical foundation to enhance organizational effectiveness and employee wellbeing despite unavoidable adversities. findings will be shared with research outlets, business practitioners, policy makers, and community members."
Collaborative Research: Modeling Stochastic Intertemporal Preferences,"this award funds research on the economic theory of human decision-making. the first part of this project will address common everyday situations where individuals make choices repeatedly over time. in many of these cases, people's preferences over various goods may change from day to day. in other words, their preferences are stochastic. this research will propose a new theoretical model to help us understand how these stochastic preferences affect choice behavior. people?s preferences to consume earlier or later would be an important factor. the second part of this project will study the welfare implications of stochastic preferences. when preferences change over time, it is unclear whether policy interventions would be beneficial and help improve individual well-being. this research will provide new tools and methodologies that will inform public policy for stochastic preferences. in general, results from this project will ultimately aid researchers in developing new insights for businesses, government agencies and other institutions that will benefit the u.s. public. this research will study the dynamics of stochastic intertemporal preferences. existing models in the stochastic choice literature have mostly taken probabilistic choice frequencies as given without explicitly modeling repetition. the first part of this project will provide a repeated choice foundation for stochastic choice. the aim will be to formalize repetition and develop a tractable (i.e., recursive) model of stochastic intertemporal preferences. existing standard models assume agents are expected utility maximizers and have standard (i.e. additive time-separable) intertemporal preferences. however, many experimental studies suggest that these standard models are too restrictive to accurately describe true human preferences. this research will take this into account and allow for more general intertemporal preferences such as epstein-zin (1989). from the perspective of inference and estimation, this will be crucial as not considering the intertemporal structure of the dynamic problem will lead to biased estimates of agents? preferences. the second part of this project will study dynamic consistency and stationarity in the context of stochastic choice. research on this has been limited partly due to the difficulty of modeling such concepts for stochastic preferences. for instance, a natural extension of stationarity to stochastic choice would always be violated whenever preferences are stochastic. this is important because traditional violations of stationarity have been viewed as instances of dynamic inconsistency and grounds for policy interventions. new definitions and characterizations of dynamic consistency and stationarity for stochastic choice are needed as imprecise definitions would lead to policy interventions that may be counter-productive or welfare-decreasing for agents"
Standard: Collaborative Research: Changing Ethical STEM Culture through Interdisciplinary Dialogue and Analysis of Humanitarian Information and Communication Technology,"the humanitarian sector has been engaged in ethical stem activities for many decades since success in humanitarian practice is based on the ability to deliver aid according to moral and ethical principles. humanitarian stem work can thus expose tensions between the ethical imperatives of humanitarian missions (e.g., accountability to those being assisted), and the typical goals of stem design, development, and use (e.g., efficiency). this project examines the implementation of stem within a humanitarian environment to offer new understandings, priorities, and directions for changing ethical cultures within the broader stem arena. it will focus on understanding how humanitarian ethical imperatives are addressed in the design, development, and implementation of stem, and how understanding of these processes can be translated into frameworks for successfully achieving more ethically-centered stem cultures. to do so, the red cross global disaster preparedness center will partner with university of washington to systematically evaluate the red cross's efforts to design and develop stem in alignment with humanitarian ethical imperatives. this human-centered approach will integrate perspectives from practitioners, stem experts, and aid beneficiaries to reveal practical challenges and solutions for achieving more ethical stem cultures. this research will provide data and information for improving how stem technologies can be integrated into humanitarian work in a more ethical manner, and for cultivating more ethical stem cultures. this project examines how stem information and communications technologies have been implemented in humanitarian working environments. the goal is to enhance understanding of how humanitarian ethics can be built into the design, development, and implementation of icts, and how lessons learned from case studies involving the red cross can be used to develop new frameworks for cultivating more ethically-centered stem cultures. this will be accomplished through analyses of case studies where humanitarian ict projects have been used to support red cross humanitarian work through a combination of literature reviews, secondary data analysis, and interviews with relevant stakeholders across the design, development, and implementation process. phase 1 involves collecting secondary data, identifying case studies, and developing research instruments. phase 2 involves analyzing the case studies. phase 3 involves assembling a practitioner-academic consortium, sharing findings, and facilitating dialogue at red cross global disaster preparedness center workshops to create practical recommendations for ethical design of humanitarian information and communications technologies. phases 4 and 5 involve preparing ethically-centered stem solutions, taking lessons to the humanitarian and academic communities for application and assessment, and disseminating project findings."
Collaborative Research: Targeting Privacy,"the project will advance three crucial themes on markets for targeted advertising and consumer privacy. the first will address whether consumers benefit or are harmed when a firm they do business with can sell their data on to other firms they might deal with. it will study whether giving individuals the right to opt out of such data sales is an effective means of protecting consumer interests. the second theme will study the consequences of giving consumers ownership over their own data with the right to sell it themselves, if they choose. the third theme will study whether the increasing precision of targeted advertising leads to excessively specialized choices for consumers in media markets supported by advertising. regulators including the us congress and the european union (with the adoption of the general data privacy regulation) have underscored the urgent need to understand these issues to draft appropriate policies to protect consumers and their data without stifling innovative business practices. the project will provide guidance on the merits of policies that restrict targeting, give consumers opt-out rights, and give consumers the right to sell their own data. the project will be primarily theoretical in its methodology, although the themes are inspired from actual current (and expanding) practices and policy debates. the first part will innovate a joint equilibrium analysis of the market where data is harvested and the market where it is deployed. the analysis will begin with a monopoly information-harvesting firm collecting data from its market to sell it on to firms in a second market. while the first firm will want to render its market attractive to consumers (through low prices, say), consumers are wary about participating, for they will rationally anticipate that their data might be used against them (in the form of high prices, say) in the secondary market. data-sharing may benefit consumers because markets where data are used operate more efficiently and consumers can command part of this gain by exacting discounts in the first market. perversely, letting individual consumers choose whether to opt out of data sharing may hurt them collectively, as consumers with ""something to hide"" are penalized with higher prices. this is a stepping stone for analyzing competition in data collection and how data harvesters parcel out data for sale. the second part will examine who should be able to sell consumer data. it will compare when firms collect and sell on the data with when consumers can sell their own data. when data are used to craft discount offers, consumers may engineer greater discount competition by pricing their data below the cost of lost privacy. individuals eager to be targeted might inflict negative externalities on others who are revealed to have strong product preferences and may face higher prices. equilibrium consequences of consumer pricing have not been previously addressed and are quite intricate. furthermore, firms should anticipate that consumers may strategically manipulate the information they sell on. this analysis will be a springboard for studying how savvy consumers will make the most of their data by selectively curating what they sell into one or more digital personas. the third part will draw on different modeling approaches of product differentiation and will meld these to an advertising-financed business model of media economics. advertisers and content consumers (who are prospective consumers of the advertised goods) constitute the two sides of the market, and they are intermediated by media platforms which choose advertising prices (and consumer subscription fees when relevant). competing platforms connect advertisers with viewers: a platform's content is most appealing to viewers with ""nearby"" tastes, and the bundle of viewers at a platform is most attractive to ""nearby"" advertisers. before internet-enabled tracking and targeting, bucketing of advertisers to consumers was crudely enabled through specialized media content. now that individuals are tracked and targeted, market performance might be enhanced through better matching but worsened through too many platforms. advertisers with broad appeal may crowd out narrow ones under the old business model, and foster insufficiently few specialized, but the new business model may go too far in the other direction. these topics have not been broached in media economics."

Collaborative Research:  Evidence in Economic Models,"this award funds research in economic theory. the team will study the acquisition and use of hard information or evidence which enables interested parties to prove some assertions they wish to make. when can social institutions be designed in such a way as to provide strong enough incentives to interested parties to acquire enough sufficiently credible evidence as to enable efficient outcomes? when efficiency is not possible, what is the nature of the distortions from efficiency generated by the best institutions that are possible? the research team will develop mathematical models for studying these questions, including tools for making the analysis sufficiently tractable to yield clear results. more broadly, the work will facilitate research of applied economic models in this large class of interesting environments. by providing tools for making the analysis more tractable, the research may generate new classes of economic institutions and shed new light on existing ones. the tools will also be useful in studying the structure of organizations, such as firms and governments. the project focuses on mechanism design when agents can acquire noisy evidence. the general model has connections to a wide range of economic models of ""hard information"", such as bayesian persuasion and models of testing. the team will develop tools for simplifying the mechanism design problem to be able to focus on a more tractable class of mechanisms. in particular, they will develop conditions under which one can identify the evidence the principal will request given any claim by the agent and/or the evidence generation actions the principal will recommend given any type report. together or separately, this identification will greatly simplify characterization of the optimal mechanism. the investigators will also compare optimal mechanisms to outcomes when the principal cannot commit himself. finally, they will characterize environments in which efficient outcomes are possible and the nature of distortions when efficiency is not achievable."
Collaborative Research: Examining Community-based Recovery Initiatives Post-Disaster,"after a recent disaster, community-based organizations known as mutual support centers emerged to organize post-disaster response. this project seeks to examine communities' perceptions of and response to programs implemented by these centers. the project asks: how have communities responded to the emergence of these centers and their projects? what areas of community development have been affected by these implemented projects? the project is focused on communities' capacity to assess and develop solutions to their needs through self-managing community development projects. the project examines how pre-existing social inequalities, which become particularly salient after natural disasters, shape the resulting community response. findings from this project will provide government agencies, social scientists, and communities with insights related to response and recovery processes. such findings can assist with policy formulation at multiple levels of government to promote recovery from disasters more efficiently, thus contributing to safety and security in our society. sociologists have identified emergent organizations as a common occurrence at the intersection of communities' response to uncertainty and failed communications between impacted communities and formal agencies. however, the ways in which these emergent actors are created, and their internal operationalization of response and recovery, are not well understood. based on a purposive sampling design, the study will examine five mutual support centers working in different communities throughout the affected region. the project uses a qualitative, multi-technique approach that includes eighty semi-structured interviews with residents of beneficiary communities where the centers have been established, two sets of focus groups with residents in each community, including forty-eight respondents, and ethnographic participant observation in center events, programs and service centers to draw a comprehensive perception of the organizations and programs. after data transcription, the project will code the data using maxqda qualitative software by first developing analytical codes followed by lower level codes reflecting characteristics and patterns in the data. findings from the project will inform sociological theories regarding disaster response, emergent organizations and their communications, and social inequality following extreme events."
Collaborative Research: Empirical Analysis of Social Networks with Unreported Links,"in many social-economic contexts, an individual's behavior depend on his own characteristics, as well as the outcome and characteristics of others. such dependence called a link; individuals with links are neighbors and a collection of neighbors is referred to as a network. a social network consists of linked individuals. this commonly occurs in applied economic research since links are often not well measured in the research data. this project will estimate the effects of social networks on individual outcomes when the links are either misclassified or not reported in data. the method proposed in this project is adaptable to a wide range of social networks. it also provide a general method for comparing various types of social effects given group characteristics. the project offers an efficient approach for policy analyses that resolves challenges due to data problems or measurement errors in network links. the results of this project provides a way to measure the effects of policies when there is no information on network structure. the results of this project will have a significant impact on empirical research on social networks and policies such as education. this will improve efficiency in business and policy decision making and in the process lead to improved well-being of u.s. citizens. this project identifies and estimates social network models when network links are either misclassified or unobserved. it first derives and characterizes conditions under which some misclassification of links does not interfere with the consistency or asymptotic properties of standard instrumental variable estimators of social effects. it then constructs a consistent estimator of social effects in a model where network links are not observed. this method does not require repeated observations of individual network members. the project will apply this estimator to data from tennessee's student/teacher achievement ratio (star) project. without observing the latent network in each classroom, the research identifies and estimate peer and contextual effects on students' performance in mathematics. the results suggests that peer effects tend to be larger in bigger classes, and that increasing peer effects significantly improve students' average test scores. the results of this research will help businesses and policy makers account for social effects in decision making hence improve the living standards of u.s. citizens."

Collaborative Research: Robo-advising and Decision Making Under Risk,"algorithmic-based advice, a.k.a robo-advice, is disrupting the access to and delivery of advice regarding industries ranging from medical services to personal-shopping to financial advising and wealth management. understanding the processes through which robo-advising affects individual decision-making is critical if we are to design advisors to benefit investors through better and tailored advice and to appropriately shape public policy with respect to the use of robo-advising. this project aims to study the effects of adopting robo-advice on the quality of decisions individuals make. the project will further the scientific knowledge about the cognitive and social impact of new technologies in the realm of professional advice to non-experts. this project aims to study the following aspects of the relationship between robo-advising and decision-making under risk: (i) the extent to which robo-advising might correct well-documented behavioral biases in decision-making under risk; (ii) the extent to which robo-advising can improve over that provided by human financial advisers; and (iii) how individual investors' algorithm aversion makes human and robo-advice complementary, in which case robo-advising may increase rather than decrease the scope for human financial advice. to address the first question, the authors will employ several empirical techniques that range from linear regression to machine learning and artificial intelligence semi-parametric methods like boosted regression trees (brt). for the second question, the authors will analyze the results of a randomized control trial involving the introduction of a tool to relax the attention constraints of financial advisers at a brokerage house. to address the third question, the authors will assess (i) whether, once given the option to access robo-advice, investors access it autonomously or reach out to human advisers for guidance; and (ii) whether, once investors start to use robo-advice, they reduce their reliance on human advisers."
Collaborative Research: A Unified Framework for Optimal Public Debt Management,"abstract government debt has an important role in an economy as decisions on government debt issuance has implications on fiscal policy and the tax system. when issuing debt, government must decide on how to rebalance its existing debt, how much new debt to issue and the duration of borrowing - between short and long-term borrowing. these decisions must be made by considering the state of the economy, including the growth rate, employment levels, inflation, interest rates and the impact of government debt issuance on bond markets. the goal of this project is to develop a framework to examine current public debt management practices and suggest ways to improve them. the project will deliver easy to use and easy to implement formulas that prescribe the optimal maturity and the optimal frequency of public debt rebalancing along with mathematical models that illustrate their usefulness. managing public debt is a crucial policy issue that concerns economists, policymakers, and the general public. there is limited practical guidance on the types of debt securities government should issue and the frequency with which a government should rebalance its debt portfolio. this proposal aims to develop a unified framework for optimal public debt management that integrates the public debt literature that imposes commitment, the literature on debt without commitment in closed and open economies, and the finance literature on optimal portfolio theory. methodologically, the proposal will expand the ""sufficient statistics"" approach that is widely used in public finance. the key deliverables will consist of formulas for optimal portfolios that summarize the normative prescriptions from large classes of models in terms of a small number of empirical moments. these moments will be estimated and used as inputs in a quantitative structural model of debt management that can be used for joint analysis of debt and tax policies."
Collaborative Research: Transparency and the Rule of Law,"scholars and policymakers agree that strong legal institutions are essential for economic development and democratic governance, yet efforts to improve the rule of law in post-communist and developing countries have frequently been stymied. recent experience offers little hope for successful top-down reforms, as entrenched elites are well-placed to undermine such efforts. this project therefore contributes to the study of law and social science and to the development of effective policies for building the rule of law by shifting attention to an innovative bottom-up, citizen-led effort to improve judicial transparency: the videotaping of court hearings by civil society organizations. the study's focus on ukraine is particularly timely given that the united states has in recent years devoted extensive resources to support ukrainian rule-of-law reforms in recognition of ukraine's prominent role in ongoing geopolitical conflicts between russia and the west. the study will consist of a large-scale field experiment. random assignment of court sessions to ""treatment"" (videotaping) and ""control"" (no videotaping) conditions will facilitate rigorous evaluation of citizen-led transparency initiatives' impact on key elements of the rule of law, including judicial outcomes, judges' and prosecutors' adherence to procedural rules, and lawyers' perceptions of the judiciary's fairness and independence. analyses will draw on surveys of lawyers and administrative data collected from ukrainian courts. the research will result in a novel data set covering approximately 2000 court sessions from five ukrainian cities."
Collaborative Research: RUI: Marriage Attitudes in the 21st Century.,"marriage is an important foundation by which individuals receive benefits guaranteed by u. s. laws, signal their transition to adulthood, and participate in family life. we know that attitudes towards marriage have changed in the late 20th and early 21st centuries as a function of evolving norms; there have also been recent changes in rates of marriage in u.s. sub-populations. yet most of what is known about attitudes towards marriage comes from much older surveys, some of which are based on geographically limited samples. this project examines american attitudes and sentiments toward issues of marriage, with particular focus on sub-populations whose take up rates of marriage have recently shifted. there will also be attention devoted to how marriage may be shaping adult lives and decision-making processes related to marriage in the 21st century. findings will help to chart how changes in attitudes towards marriage may be tied to larger societal changes in laws, attitudes, and for whom such changes are most notable. findings will have implications for policies relevant to supporting marriage as one foundation for social life in the united states. this project investigates marriage attitudes in the early 21st century using both quantitative and qualitative methods. the first component will be a survey based on a national sample of 2,700 adults. the project will build on previously tested survey questions and add questions related to the experience of marriage as well as divorce. this will permit comparisons across sub-groups that vary by social characteristics. the survey will also allow comparisons across regional contexts, comparing adults in states with varying histories of marriage support. the second component will consist of interviews with 120 individuals. interview questions will focus on explaining reasons behind attitudes and decisions to marry or opt out. the sampling strategy for the interview component allows comparisons between those living in four different social contexts, thus enriching the regional comparisons afforded by the survey data. the findings will inform sociological theories regarding marriage, divorce, and related changes across the life course that implicate both legal rights as well as family formation and change. this project is jointly funded by sociology program and the established program to stimulate competitive research (epscor)."
SBP:Collaborative Research: A Two-Part Project Examining Team Discrimination by Gender in STEM teams and a Way Forward,"though gender issues are pervasive throughout stem (i.e., science, technology, engineering, and math) careers, representation of women is lowest in engineering. a myriad of reasons for low female participation in engineering have been investigated, such as pay and promotion opportunities and family-related constraints. attention has also been given to the role of workplace discrimination, as women in stem experience discrimination at higher rates than women in non-stem disciplines. however, few researchers have focused their attention on how the day-to-day experiences of women in engineering might facilitate or impede discriminatory behavior. while many of the existing studies on workplace discrimination have focused on the individual or the organization, we argue that teams play an overlooked role in women's experiences in engineering. taking a team-centric approach, we examine interpersonal discrimination and its multi-level ripple impact on both individual and team outcomes. the current project is designed to complete three high-level objectives. our first objective is to identify whether and how engineering team experiences differ by gender, specifically in relation to team discrimination. as a second objective, we will examine the effect team discrimination has on engineering team outcomes (e.g., performance, creativity). finally, our third objective is to examine the impact team discrimination has on individual-level outcomes and specifically the career trajectory of female engineers. to effectively carry out the stated objectives, we will use complementary methods to conduct two primary studies. we will begin with a multilevel, longitudinal examination of discrimination in stem teams, specifically in relation to female team members. this first study will address the concern regarding a lack of longitudinal, team-level data and provide insight regarding an understudied phenomenon, team discrimination. we follow with an experience sampling study examining team discrimination toward females working within the stem field and the effects of such occurrences throughout their daily lives and long-term career aspirations and decisions. the culmination of this program will provide a greater understanding of how team experiences shape the career path for women in stem, with the overall goal of retaining women in stem careers."
Collaborative Research: Building a Multi-User Database of District Court Decisions,"despite the obvious importance of the federal district courts, less scholarly attention has been directed to these courts, particularly as compared to studies of the u.s. supreme court or the u.s. courts of appeal. in part this is because available databases have not been disseminated in the most user-friendly format and because they lack important variables. foremost among these underutilized datasets is the integrated database (idb) of federal district court decisions distributed by the federal judicial center in conjunction with the administrative office of the united states courts. however, even though the idb has been publicly available since the 1980s, it is almost never used by social scientists studying the courts because idb does not contain information on the identity of the judges presiding over trials nor on the litigants of the case. because of this, scholars are unable to incorporate attitudinal/ideological and litigant characteristic variables in models of judicial behavior. this research addresses this shortcoming by supplying judge and litigant information for a sample of the idb, thus rendering the database more useful to scholars and providing researchers with the opportunity to utilize the idb to examine decision making at the federal trial court level. the research will use the new data to examine and test party capability theory, which asserts that the ""haves"" come out ahead. the research will examine the conditions under which federal district court judges render decisions according to the characteristics and resources of the litigants and the attitude/ideology of the judge. the research uses a two-prong strategy to code this additional information. initially, the plan will code a random sample stratified by year of 4000 cases per year for ten years, to collect information regarding litigant type using the comprehensive categories developed by songer for the courts of appeals database. because this initial stratified random sample is likely to include a vast majority of procedural terminations decided before the case goes to trial, the plan will code an additional ""over-sample"" of 1000 merits terminations per year. this will provide a dataset of 5000 observations per year, across ten separate years, containing both procedural terminations (generated through the initial random sample) and merits terminations (based on the initial random sample and subsequent over-sample). moreover, instead of picking a single ten-year period, the research will code the sample of 5000 cases from every other year over a 20-year period, 1995 through 2015. this time span allows the tracking of institutional changes to the district courts across four presidential administrations. collecting this information will allow scholars to conduct various analyses on the preliminary motions and evidentiary motions potentially leading to settlements rather than trials, as well as the situations in which the merits of a dispute are litigated in a trial."
Collaborative Research: How between-group competition impacts within-group cooperation,"popular belief holds that nothing unites like a common enemy, but to what degree is this true? recent advances in economics, anthropology and psychology support the existence of a phenomenon in which conflict between groups improves cooperation within those groups. this has disturbing implications for a society whose goal is to improve cooperation, suggesting that between-group conflict is necessary to enhance within-group cooperation. the goal of this project is to determine the degree to which this is true and use the information to formulate possibilities for improving cooperation in the absence of intergroup conflict. understanding this would benefit society from the level of local interactions to international relations. the project will also train numerous students at the undergraduate, graduate, and postgraduate levels in the methods of scientific inquiry and bring this research to the general public through talks to the general public, at local k-12 schools, and through our ongoing collaboration with the fernbank museum of natural history. technical description: recent research suggests the existence of parochial altruism, in which between-group competition improves within-group cooperation. from an evolutionary perspective, this makes sense, as individuals within a group, who cooperate to outcompete other groups, will do better than individuals who fail to do so. but to what extent is this a broad feature of cooperative behavior versus a characteristic specific to humans? if this is a general disposition of cooperation, how frequently is it really a driver of cooperation? the overarching goals of the current proposal are to 1) understand the impact of between-group competition on cooperation and 2) the hormonal mechanisms underlying these decisions. to achieve these goals the researchers will examine how monkeys, apes and humans cooperate with other members of their group, with and without between-group competition. the focus will be on individuals interacting within their social groups, who are freely choosing to work jointly with other members of their group, but in tightly controlled circumstances that allow the influence of specific variables to be identified. this approach combines the best aspects of naturalistic field work, highlighting the endogenous emergence of cooperation from individual interactions, and the best aspects of tightly controlled experiments, highlighting the mechanisms and clarifying how specific contexts influence cooperation. levels of two hormones purported to be key to understanding cooperation, testosterone and oxytocin, will be collected during the interactions to begin to unpack the endocrine mechanisms underlying cooperation and competition. this work will help to untangle uniquely human characteristics of cooperation from those more broadly shared across the primates and help elucidate core mechanisms that promote cooperation, either in concert with, or in the absence of, human-specific adaptations."
Collaborative Research: Judicial Legitimacy in Comparative Perspective,"political incumbents around the world commonly introduce legislation to undermine or politicize the judicial branch of government, such as ""packing"" the court's membership, or reducing the court's ability to decide certain cases. political scientists have long thought that citizens will punish incumbents who advance these ""court curbing"" proposals in the next election. nevertheless, these attacks continue. this project seeks to understand the conditions under which voters are both willing and able punish incumbent politicians who undermine high courts, as well as the circumstances under which politicians may actually benefit from these interbranch assaults. the researchers will explain variation in citizens' support for judicial institutions in 12 countries as a function of their satisfaction with the court's policymaking, their democratic values, their support for incumbents, and the political context in which they live. understanding the foundations and consequences of judicial legitimacy around the globe is essential for building and maintaining the rule of law worldwide. the key intellectual contribution of this study is the use of an original survey experiment, fielded in 12 countries around the world, to probe the electoral costs and benefits of interbranch attacks for incumbent politicians. the experiment relies on a novel dependent variable, a citizen's willingness to withdraw support from an incumbent who openly seeks to undermine courts, to examine directly a behavioral manifestation of legitimacy theory. because public support is a theoretical antecedent to a willingness to punish incumbents for court curbing proposals, the surveys will contain validated measures of individuals' willingness to ascribe institutional legitimacy to judicial institutions, the first fielding of these items on cross-national surveys in over a quarter-century. with these original data, the researchers will test differences in the foundations of institutional legitimacy across countries. the theoretical framework for this research emphasizes the role of democratic values, a concept that is often referenced in existing studies of judicial legitimacy but has not been tested in a systematic fashion. this project therefore advances beyond earlier attempts to understand judicial legitimacy in its theoretical focus, experimental design, and the breadth of data incorporated into the study. findings from this research will inform political scientists, legal scholars, policymakers and academics to better understand the public foundations of judicial independence and the rule of law, two foundational concepts in governance across continents."
"Collaborative Research: Productivity, Efficiency, and Distortions in the U.S. Shale Boom","abstract widespread improvements in the productivity of hydraulic fracturing and horizontal drilling (fracking) have dramatically reshaped u.s. energy markets, unlocking nearly $1 trillion of previously uneconomic shale oil and gas reserves. this project develops a detailed database that links data on mineral leases and well-level drilling and production in the u.s. the project then uses this database to document the causes of productivity growth in the u.s. shale business and measure barriers to further improvements in efficiency. this research examines how firms economic and contractual environment shapes oil and gas productivity and resource allocation. by combining evidence across multiple u.s. shale plays, the project will provide the first large-scale evidence of how changes in the efficiency of the industry have affected u.s. oil and gas markets. moreover, the construction of the database is a valuable contribution that substantially facilitates the entry of future researchers into empirical work on the u.s. oil and gas industry. the first study will quantify the economic distortions generated by contractual features in mineral leases, which are agreements between oil and gas firms and private landowners. this research studies how primary term and royalty clauses in mineral leases affect firms? drilling decisions and measures their aggregate impact on hydrocarbon supply. the second study will measure the effect of oil and gas price booms and busts on productivity growth. many industry participants argue that productivity improvements are greatest during a bust, due to the freeing up of human capital from day-to-day drilling activity. this argument runs counter to standard models in which productivity improvements are most valuable and therefore undertaken when prices are high. this project will provide the first empirical evidence as to when large productivity improvements actually occur in the shale industry. the third study will explore the wide distribution of firm size in u.s. shale business, which is suggestive of important differences across firms in productivity, and the scope for misallocation of mineral assets. this study will measure the productivity of firms and parcels and then characterize the conditions under which inefficient allocations are generated and persist. overall, these projects will advance the knowledge on economy-wide productivity and misallocation. the oil and gas industry provides an ideal setting to study these questions because data on both investment and investment outcomes are available at the level of the individual investment. further, the database linking information on drilling, completions, and production to mineral leases allow for identification in this setting."
Collaborative Research: Behavioral Consequences of Excessive Confidence,"a common lay theory states that a lack of confidence is a barrier to performance in many areas of life, such as athletic and scholastic performance. the assumption is that an underperforming individual could better live up to their potential if they only could enhance their confidence. this stands in stark contrast to conclusions from behavioral decision research, which finds that people are generally overconfident. by this account, increasing confidence without concurrently increasing knowledge should produce a host of negative outcomes, such as maladaptive risk taking and ignoring relevant information. this work attempts to reconcile these views, by showing that unjustified confidence in knowledge (i.e., confidence after controlling for knowledge) has both positive and negative effects, and that the resulting impact on decision outcomes is situation-specific. by doing so, this work will help inform interventions that target people's confidence levels. to accomplish this goal, this 4-year research project introduces a theoretical framework for investigating the effects of unjustified confidence in knowledge and uses this framework to advance our understanding of how unjustified confidence influences decision outcomes. this project leverages a mixture of research designs, including survey-based and experimental studies. phase 1, in year 1, will lay the groundwork by identifying the most promising interventions for increasing and decreasing confidence and scoping promising psychological and behavioral mechanisms by which confidence can influence decision outcomes. phase 2, in years 2 and 3, will test individual pathways from unjustified confidence to decision outcomes. these studies will build up to phase 3, in year 4, which will involve a large-scale test of how unjustified confidence affects psychological processes (such as expecting good decision outcomes), how these in turn influence behavioral processes (such as risk taking), how these effects are influenced by environmental factors (e.g., ease of use of new information), and how these ultimately influence decision outcomes. this project will end by constructing a comprehensive model of the consequences of confidence, which will guide future research and interventions to improve decision making."

Collaborative Research: A National Assessment of Victimization Risk and Crime Reporting,"the u.s. crime statistics system historically has not incorporated information about citizenship status, and thus there is little scientific evidence that can inform whether immigrants are more or less likely than native-born americans to be criminally victimized. such an information deficit also means we do not know whether immigrants are more or less likely than natives to report crimes to the police. this project capitalizes on a recent redesign of the u.s. national crime victimization survey (ncvs), which adds information about respondents' citizenship status, to offer the first large-scale comparison of victimization risk and crime reporting among u.s. native-born citizens, naturalized citizens, and non-citizens. the results of the project will reveal how citizenship status shapes personal exposure to crime and decisions about whether to report crimes to the police. additionally, the project will examine whether these patterns vary among individuals from different racial and ethnic groups and among those who reside in communities with divergent approaches to immigration policy and law enforcement. the project will benefit policy-makers at all governmental levels by providing key information regarding patterns of crime victimization and crime reporting among u.s. residents. findings will also inform police leadership regarding these patterns, thus contributing to u.s. safety and security. the project has three primary objectives: (1) to assess the quality of the new self-reported citizenship data in the ncvs for purposes of developing adjustments (if needed) for any observed nonresponse bias; (2) to examine the effect of citizenship status on victimization risk and how it may be conditioned by individual- and community-level factors; and (3) to examine the effect of citizenship status on crime reporting to the police and how it may be conditioned by individual- and community-level conditions. the project will integrate nationally representative individual-level data on victimization and crime reporting from the redesigned 2016-2020 national crime victimization survey (ncvs) and community-level data from the american community survey (acs) and a variety of other sources including reports of state immigration legislation, lexisnexis, and immigration and customs enforcement (ice) documents. multivariate logistic regression models will be estimated to achieve project objectives. the results will yield new evidence about the safety and well-being of native-born citizens and foreign-born persons in the context of rapidly changing economic, demographic, and political conditions in the us. the project will which enhance knowledge about the quality of survey-derived measures of citizenship and will provide the first ever assessment at the national level of whether immigrant status is associated with victimization risk and decisions to notify the police about crime incidents. these findings will inform sociological theories regarding crime, immigration and citizenship status, as well as criminological theories related to crime victimization and mobilization of the law, with implications for additional literatures in political science and survey methodology."
Collaborative Research:  Preference Structures,"this award funds research in economic theory. the research team seeks to develop a model of how individuals make decisions. they propose a framework that could be an alternative to the standard approach of modeling economic preferences. the team wants to replace this standard approach with an alternative that can better explain results from experimental and behavioral economics. they seek to develop an approach that is quite general, so that it can be applied to any economic decision. their model will replace the simple preference relation (which ranks all alternatives) with a concept they call a preference structure. preference structures include two relations. the first captures all rankings that the individual finds easy or straightforward. the second relation that comes from observing how the individual makes decisions between two alternatives, whether that decision is easy or hard. the goal is to provide new methods for behavioral economics. if the project provides a more accurate way to model actual decision making that can also be used to predict future decisions, it would be useful in a wide variety of practical contexts in business management and public policy. the model of preference structures includes two binary relations. the first captures easy rankings. as cyclical choice patterns are unlikely to rise from easy pairwise choice problems, this relation is required to be transitive but not necessarily complete. the second relation is complete but may not be transitive. the two relations are consistent. this model subsumes many preference models, such as those that allow for indecisiveness, imperfect ability of discrimination, regret, and completions based on recommendations. moreover, there is a natural way of modeling the choice behavior induced by a preference structure by using the notion of top-cycles. this leads to a generalization of standard rational choice theory which meets three goals. it has predictive power, it has appealing existence and uniqueness properties, and it provides ways of empirically eliciting preference structures from choice data. the team plans to explore several avenues, from classical consumer theory to game theory. they also hope to consider decision making under risk and uncertainty."
Collaborative Research: Lifecycle Savings and Retirement Planning,"saving for retirement and the allocation of accumulated savings upon retirement are two of the most consequential financial decisions that u.s. households make. yet, the available evidence suggests that individuals do not save adequately for their retirement, despite access to tax deferred retirement accounts. further, upon retirement, households seem reluctant to make use of annuities which provide insurance against longevity risk more efficiently than self-insurance. finally, many households claim social security benefits at the earliest possible opportunity at a substantial reduction in their monthly benefits. this project seeks to understand such decisions and what might be done to encourage households to make better decisions using theory and experiments with paid human subjects. thus, the goals of this project are in line with the nsf's mission to advance national prosperity and welfare. this project consists of three main studies, each of which place subjects in a realistic, individual choice setting and explore the decisions they make in that setting, where the decisions are incentivized by monetary payments. experimental subjects will be a mix of university students and a broader, more demographically rich subject population recruited from amazon mechanical turk. the first study explores the role of tax deferred accounts (tda) for savings decisions. the aim of this project is to understand how tdas affect savings choices and how ""nudges"" such as automatic enrollment in tdas might improve savings behavior. the second study explores the annuitization decision that households face at the time of retirement. the aim of this project is to understand the factors affecting annuity take-up. the third study explores why retirees don't delay taking social security benefits. the goal of this project is to understand both the positive and normative aspects of the retirement benefit redemption decision."

RUI: Collaborative Research: Assessments and Stances Regarding the Uncertainty of (Un)Desired Outcomes,"inaccuracies in expectations and predictions about future outcomes can ruin decision making and optimal planning. one pernicious type of inaccuracy is an optimism bias, in which preferred outcomes are viewed as more likely than warranted and/or unpreferred outcomes are viewed as less likely than warranted. optimism biases lead to problematic individual behaviors like unwise risk taking and over-purchasing, human tragedies like deaths from engineering failures and societally important phenomena like stock market bubbles. motivational goals are often assumed to underlie optimism biases but there is an inadequate understanding of when different goals impact optimism, including goals that have the potential to reduce optimism and promote accuracy. in fact, major theories assume that preferences for outcomes and expectations about the outcomes are independent, which is inconsistent with some empirical findings. the proposed research addresses this discrepancy. the research is structured by a novel goal-biased expectations framework, which posits contextual features that shape the balance between two orientations that a person can take toward forming expectations. the balance of orientations ultimately determines whether and how goals shape expectations. the framework is also useful for developing steps to debias or reduce overoptimism and promote accuracy among professional forecasters and the public. debiasing overoptimism can yield improved predictions and ultimately better planning, preparation, and outcomes across many contexts (e.g., financial, health, security). three lines of experiments will be conducted. one line will examine the scope of, and processes responsible for, a crucial difference in how measures of expectations are affected by outcome desirability or preference. past research findings have returned quite different indicators of the extent to which outcome desirability has a biasing influence, but these differences might align with a distinction between two ways in which expectations are commonly solicited in studies and in everyday contexts. a second line will address how types of available information influence the desirability bias. one surprising possibility is that as information becomes more clear, people's orientation and goals shift in a manner that produces more bias rather than less. a third line will test a novel debiasing intervention for overoptimism. participants in the studies will include sports fans, owners of homes in floodplains, and patients?three groups known to exhibit overoptimism. all of the proposed work will inform the validity of the goal-biased expectations framework. the studies on this grant will involve collaboration with graduate and undergraduate students, and therefore will play important roles in their research training/education."
"Collaborative Research: Piecewise Linear Approximations for DSGE Models With Occasionally-Binding Constraints: Solution, Estimation, Model Evaluation, and Applications","central banks regulators use mathematical models to understand fluctuations in economic activity and the effects of the bank's policies. current methods used to analyze the general effects of policy changes on relationships among large-scale economic variables, such as total output, inflation, and interest rate are either not able to capture the effects of some extreme events, such as decreasing interest to zero, or are too slow and costly to implement. this research project will develop new, faster, cheaper, and better methods to analyze the effects of policy changes on large-scale variables in the economy. the results of this research project will therefore contribute to economic science, and more important, allow for a better understanding of how policy changes or external influences are transmitted throughout the larger economy. this will allow economist to provide more informed advice to policymakers and in so doing, enhance economic growth and improve the living standards of americans. the tools developed in this project can also be applied anywhere in the world, thus establishing the u.s. as the global leader in the development of economic analytical tools. prior to the great recession, models of linear relationship among macro variables used by the fed and other regulatory agencies were able to capture the most important features of aggregate time series and generate accurate predictions. however, during and after the great recession, nonlinearities generated by occasionally-binding constraints such as an effective lower bound constraint on nominal interest rates, have become the norm. this research project will develop new techniques to construct nonlinear solutions to macroeconomic models in which occasionally-binding constraints play an important role. the goal of the proposed research is to develop and apply a piecewise-linear solution method that trades off a little of accuracy against computational speed and is scalable to large models used by central banks. the project will also develop a class of flexible models that can be used to assess whether models that impose strong theoretical restrictions are well specified. the results of this project will provide researchers with new analytical tools that will improve the quality of policy advice as well as regulation. this could increase economic growth in the u.s. and improve the lives of citizens."

Collaborative Research: The Aratus Project on Astronomy and Scientific Writing,"this collaborative research project in the history of science will produce the first full english translations of the commentaries and scholia to aratus's literary work, phaenomena, a popular text poem dealing with astronomy of greek and roman antiquity. it presented an accessible summary of star lore based upon a now lost work of eudoxus, and it was an immediate and lasting success as an introductory text to astronomy; an immense exegetical literature grew up around it. this literature included commentaries written by both experts in astronomy, such as hipparchus, and non-expert authors, as well as scholia (marginal notes) written in copies of his work. the project will explore the reception of aratus's work among later commentators, and compare the way that the latter read, understood, and interacted with this text and the astronomy it contained. results of this project will be made public through a dedicated website which will make available ancient texts with modern english translations for the first time; they will be made accessible through an innovative and open access online platform that will display the text of aratus and of its commentaries and scholia, along with interactive visualizations of the astronomy they contain. in addition, the pi will produce a scholarly monograph on hipparchus' commentary to aratus, and she will develop an exhibition and new courses on ancient astronomy and history of science. this project is a pioneering investigation in history of science. it has four main goals. it will bring aratus and his under-appreciated exegetical community to light, study the commentary of hipparchus under the light of the debate about the nature of science and of the best genres to disseminate it, discuss the ancient reception of aratus among different types of readership, and discuss the different genres of scientific writing in antiquity. the authors of these ancient texts form an understudied community of thinkers, who held widely varying opinions on aratus' status as an authority on astronomy. the project will highlight this forgotten intellectual world, and it will broaden the traditional canon of ancient authors by translating many of these texts into modern english for the first time and making them freely available through an online digital portal. one key figure under investigation in the project is hipparchus, who responds to aratus and with whom ptolemy deeply engages; understanding this missing intellectual link is critical to studies of ancient science. the pi will produce an edition and commentary on hipparchus' commentary to aratus that will be published as an independent, scholarly monograph. the project is also innovative for its social history of scientific writing and of commentary as a genre; the authors of these texts were all writing sciences but using very different genres and media."
Collaborative Research: Informal risk-sharing and private initiative to mitigate local environmental risks,"for thousands of communities in the united states the environment, natural or contaminated, presents challenges to human health. these risks are often highly localized and therefore avoidable. many americans depend on well water that often is below the standards set by regulatory actions pursuant to the safe drinking water act. one approach to reduce contaminants is to rely on the government to mitigate these risks and reduce the welfare impact of adverse outcomes through the provision of local public goods, including safe drinking water and health services. government provision of such public goods, however, is not always adequate. the assumptions underlying this project is that such limitations may be overcome by (a) exploiting private risk to achieve greater cooperation, building upon the ""veil of ignorance"" concept of john rawls to foster cooperation for public goods; (b) departing from the pitfalls of either extreme of public or private goods only by focusing on sharing of privately-owned resources; and (c) exploring how information and social-networks increase cooperation as well as encouraging private investments in mitigation technologies. to test these concepts, the researchers have chosen as context a major disaster of natural origin: toxic levels of arsenic in groundwater pumped by millions of private wells across bangladesh. information on individual risk, in this case well tests for arsenic, are provided in ways that encourage greater cooperation and investment through the sharing of safe wells and the installation of new safe wells. the findings have implications for environmental policy in the united states as high-resolution data on water, air, and soil quality become increasingly accessible to citizens. more specifically, this research studies the role of risk-sharing and social networks in perception and mitigation of local environmental risks. the research team focuses on two aspects: increasing cooperation for risk mitigation and increasing private investment in risk mitigation technology. this project is based in a setting where these two factors become particularly important due to a lack of government-provided resources for reducing environmental risk. the research first tests whether informal insurance, where compliance may be primarily enforced by existing social structure and reciprocity norms, can effectively counter the undersupply of local public goods. then, the team studies how social-networks can help in increasing cooperation, adoption and investment in risk mitigation technology. to understand the channels, this project explores how information on risk can facilitate more cooperation and risk mitigation. this relatively low-cost approach is different from the current approach of the government of bangladesh which is focused on expensive infrastructure of limited reach. the study is a randomized controlled trial in rural bangladesh, where the researchers randomly assign interventions on (a) ex-ante risk sharing, (b) information provision on risk, and (c) the demonstration of intermediate-depth wells which yield low arsenic. the original data allow the research team to test the effectiveness of these interventions in terms of mitigation efforts and reduction in arsenic exposure to the population. the experimental design allows for documentation of the causal impact of the interventions. the research team intends to share the results with policy makers and organizations so that lessons learnt here can be applied in similar settings."
Collaborative Research: Technological Shocks and Institutional Effectiveness under Heterogeneous Risk,"scholars have long been interested in the linkages between governance institutions and the sustainability of common-pool resources (cprs), of which oil and gas are canonical examples. institutions that facilitate efficient collective action are often seen as the best hope for a solution to the tragedy of the commons, and the long endurance of institutions is often viewed as a best-case scenario. long-enduring institutions, however, lock participants in to a particular path that may or may not be efficient when exogenous changes occur. this project expands on the intellectual tradition of cpr scholars by examining how a solution to a dilemma today can exacerbate a different cpr dilemma tomorrow. the problem with such institutions is not necessarily the possibility of resource collapse (i.e., a tragedy of the commons), but rather of continued action in the face of substantially changed circumstances. cpr governance institutions can continue to be used to facilitate collective action long after collective action ceases to be efficient or equitable for the group. previously stable and efficient institutions may now have the effect of redistributing rents from those who are least vulnerable to the new risks introduced by an exogenous shock to those who are most vulnerable. this research examines the changing implications of oil and gas production and regulation in the united states. how effective are existing regulations at managing the risks from high volume hydraulic fracturing (hvhf), commonly known as ""fracking?"" hvhf is a technique for producing oil and gas from shale formations that has revolutionized the domestic energy landscape. in the u.s., states are the primary regulators of oil and gas production, so there is variation in the types of and effectiveness of regulations in-use. many of these regulations were enacted in the early-to-mid 1900s and were designed to manage conventional oil and gas production. given the rapid expansion of hvhf across the country, this research explores the effects of these regulations and hvhf production techniques. the project first develops a cross-state database of current regulations used to manage oil and gas production, which will be available online for the public, state regulators, journalists, and academics to explore how different states manage oil and gas production and how effective those regulations are. second, the project engages landowners in focus groups to better understand the perspectives of people impacted, both positively and negatively, by the hvhf boom. third, the project uses a series of laboratory economic experiments to advance scholarly understanding, in a controlled setting, of how different regulations incentivize individual decisions whether to sign leases to allow oil and gas production."
"Collaborative Research: Organizational development, operations, and new media among civilian flood-rescue groups","in this project, the stability or formalization and growth of volunteer groups and the use of social media in these processes will be investigated. specifically, processes of conducting volunteer flood rescues, factors that affect immediate decision-making during rescues, decisions about volunteer group development, and use of social media for rescuing and group development will be researched through intense interviewing and participation with rescuers. disasters are unique opportunities to study social processes, and they are also becoming more frequent social problems. disasters of recent years have introduced volunteer organizations supported by social media and new technologies. limited scholarly research has studied this volunteer rescue movement, these volunteers, or these rescue operations. findings will contribute to scholarly understanding of group formation and development and how this may be affected by new technologies. they also will contribute to public welfare by being integrated in courses such as on emergency management and hazard mitigation and recovery, and by being directly shared with organizations that do rescues as well as the broader emergency management and public communities. to address the research goal, ethnographic research will be conducted that includes participation with volunteer organizations that conduct rescues, 20-40 interviews with emergency management officials, 30-60 interviews with volunteer rescuers, and 20-30 interviews with persons rescued by civilian volunteers. over the life of the project, this will involve training and traveling with volunteer organizations as they respond to disasters, such as the three to which these organizations responded in 2018, hurricanes florence and michael and floods in southeast texas. participation will be in three different roles: boat rescuer, dispatcher, and leadership coordination. in addition, available social media data and media articles will be collected and analyzed inductively. gis technology will be used to analyze available geospatial data on rescue locations, which will be related to hazard data."
Collaborative Research: SBP: Broadening participation: Reducing the consequences of subtle discrimination in STEM,"broadening the participation of underrepresented groups in science, technology, engineering, and math (stem) is a critical goal in the staffing, management, and effectiveness of the u.s. workforce. indeed, african american and hispanic people comprise less than 10% of the stem workforce. the overarching goal of the proposed research is to increase the recruitment, retention, and preparation of hispanic and african american students for stem careers. we focus on the subtle yet significant messages that minority students encounter in stem contexts that undermine their success. we uniquely consider the ways that allies, or majority group members who strive to end oppression toward, and advocate on behalf of, minority group members, can effectively address subtle discrimination, and thus ultimately support the stem interest, efficacy, achievement, and workplace success of minority students. in summary, the findings from this work will serve as an impetus for scholarship on minority stress interventions and ally engagement. additionally, it will offer immediately applicable strategies for retaining african american and hispanic students in stem, a necessary step for increasing the representation of racial minorities in the u.s. stem workforce. this research pursues the overarching goal of developing and testing strategies that enhance the retention of african american and hispanic students in stem careers by identifying and evaluating ally behaviors that reduce the detrimental consequences of subtle discrimination. one explanation for this shortage is the subtle differences in students' formative college experiences. in so doing, we build and test a conceptual model that uniquely integrates attributional ambiguity and stress and coping theories with emerging insights about the influence of allies. we advance robust logic based on evidence from the fields related to the organizational science to propose that the ambiguity of subtle discrimination depletes cognitive and affective resources necessary for achievement in stem. this reasoning reflects the first thorough analysis of why and how subtle discrimination is problematic and points directly to ambiguity reduction strategies as powerful theory-driven buffers of these effects. we blend complementary methods of experience sampling and laboratory experiment to build theoretically meaningful and practically useful knowledge. this work will provide specific, evidence-based strategies to support african american and hispanic college students, thereby enhancing their stem interest, efficacy, motivation, achievement, and ultimately career choice and success in organizations. in particular, we focus on the previously unexamined role of motivated observers--allies--in reducing the consequences of subtle discrimination for its targets and thus catalyze new diversity science."
Collaborative Research: Video-Recording Eyewitness Identification Lineups: Testing for Unanticipated Costs and Undiscovered Benefits,"one of the primary recommendations regarding eyewitness evidence is to video record witnesses' lineup identifications. the underlying rationale for this recommendation is intuitive: a video-record provides information about deviations from best practices and may promote lineup administrator compliance with established guidelines. as much as these benefits resonate with psychological researchers, there is no research on any potential costs to video-recording. for example, it is unknown whether the act of video-recording negatively impacts witnesses' decision-making process. furthermore, the intuitive benefits described above are likely a small subset of the potential advantages of video-recording identification procedures. the purpose of the proposed studies is, therefore, to test for possible additional benefits to video-recording that might accrue across the spectrum of an eyewitness's interaction with the justice system and to identify potential costs of the recommendation. the results from the proposed research will either provide additional support for this recommendation, thereby encouraging reluctant police departments to adopt the practice, or will highlight concerns regarding its implementation. as responsible advocates of science-based recommendations, psychological scientists must find answers to these questions in order to determine how to implement this recommendation. the research will be conducted in three phases. in the first phase, an experiment tests whether video-recordings of eyewitness lineup identifications reveal different non-verbal behaviors between accurate and inaccurate witnesses, information which could be used by the legal system to assess witness reliability. in addition, the experiment tests whether witnesses make different identification decisions as a function of being recorded, as predicted by theoretical models of eyewitness decision-making. the second phase tests whether showing witnesses a video of their own identification inoculates witnesses from harmful confidence inflation produced by post-identification feedback, a potentially beneficial effect predicted by theoretical models of eyewitness confidence assessment. one experiment in this phase tests whether this effect is moderated by camera perspective; a second experiment tests whether this effect is moderated by the difficulty of the lineup task. the final phase tests whether showing fact-finders a video of an eyewitness identification procedure assists them in discriminating accurate from inaccurate witnesses. one experiment in this phase tests whether this benefit depends on fact-finders' prior beliefs about the guilt of the identified person. a second experiment tests whether an empirically-validated checklist containing information about witnesses' non-verbal cues to accuracy improves the ability to discriminate accurate from inaccurate witnesses. as a whole, the proposed experiments test heretofore unexamined benefits and costs of video-recording eyewitnesses' identifications. from a practical perspective, data from these experiments can be used to develop recommendations regarding how to implement the video-recording recommendation as well as how to use those video-recordings to improve fact-finder decision-making. from a theoretical perspective, data obtained from these experiments might suggest essential refinements to models of witness decision-making and retrospective confidence reports."
Collaborative Research: Emerging Cultures of Data Science Ethics in the Academy and Industry,"the 'big data' era has created new scientific roles in the form of 'data scientists' - specialized information knowledge workers who apply technical and research skills to derive knowledge from large-scale databases. concomitant with the creation of these new roles, however, has been the rise of high-profile controversies around the potential abusive use of big data and of the algorithms whose creation they enable. this project thus focuses on 'data science ethics' and works to understand how to best cultivate a culture of ethics in data science. it will assess the state, structure, and substance of data ethics in both educational and industrial contexts. within the academic sector, the project will conduct interviews with faculty and undergraduates and analyze relevant syllabi to develop an account of what constitutes data ethics in the academy. comparing these data across faculty and disciplines will show major areas of agreement and disagreement over what data ethics education should entail. within the industrial sector, the project will research how data ethics are beginning to figure into corporate practice and study how companies define data ethics and attempt to integrate ethical considerations into everyday work. data will come from in-depth interviews with those in industry and analyses of corporate documents from companies that have made public commitments to addressing data ethics. the pis would then compare data and findings from across these two contexts to identify commonalities, differences, and useful strategies for advancing data ethics across social contexts and professional sectors. this project will draw together a diverse group of researchers who in collaboration with educators and data science practitioners will: (1) document and assess barriers and opportunities for integrating ethics into data science practice; (2) assess the continuities and discontinuities emerging between industrial and academic contexts; and (3) develop a foundation for cohesive, comprehensive, integrative data ethics education. the investigators will use a range of complementary methods to do so, including qualitative interviews, expert judgement, and quantitative computational analyses of the latent thematic and topical structure of documents from academia and industry. project outcomes and findings will be disseminated through conferences, journals, and through holding a synthetic workshop after the completion of data collection and analysis."

Collaborative Research: FW-HTF: Augmented Cognition for Teaching: Transforming Teacher Work with Intelligent Cognitive Assistants,"the future of work at the human-technology frontier (fw-htf) is one of 10 new big ideas for future investment announced by nsf. the fw-htf cross-directorate program aims to respond to the challenges and opportunities of the changing landscape of jobs and work by supporting convergent research. this award fulfills part of that aim. k-12 stem teachers are critical to the us economy. with investments in teaching quality representing enormous economic value, the quality of education has been identified as a significant determinant of gross domestic product economic growth. however, the us teacher workforce is experiencing a crisis: teacher demand exceeds supply at every level, and attrition is extraordinarily high for new teachers. further, while stem teaching represents one of the areas of highest need, stem teachers leave the profession at high rates. these developments call for innovative workforce augmentation technologies to improve k-12 stem teachers' performance and quality of work-life. to address this critical national need, the project will investigate how intelligent cognitive assistants for teachers can transform teacher work to significantly increase teacher performance and teacher quality of work-life. the project centers on the design, development, and evaluation of the intelligent augmented cognition for teaching (i-act) framework for intelligent cognitive assistants for teachers. with a focus on assisting k-12 stem teachers in technology-rich inquiry teaching that supports collaborative, problem-based stem learning, i-act cognitive assistants provide teachers with (1) prospective pedagogical guidance (preparation support preceding classroom teaching), (2) concurrent pedagogical guidance (real-time support during classroom teaching), and (3) retrospective pedagogical guidance (reflection support within a community of practice following classroom teaching). the project will culminate with an experiment conducted with a fully implemented version of i-act in public middle schools in north carolina and indiana. the project realizes its objective through two primary thrusts. first, the research team will design and develop i-act cognitive assistants for k-12 stem teachers and test them in public school classrooms. utilizing ai-based multimodal learning analytics and a social constructivist theory of pedagogy, i-act cognitive assistants use machine-learned models of teacher orchestration to provide guidance throughout the full teaching workflow. i-act cognitive assistants operate in a tight feedback loop in which collected data will drive successive iterations of machine learning to train refined teacher support models for improved i-act cognitive assistant functionalities. second, the research team will investigate how i-act cognitive assistants improve k-12 stem teacher performance and teacher quality of work-life. the team will conduct focus groups, case studies, semi-structured interviews, and observations of teachers using i-act cognitive assistants in school implementations with middle school science teachers at the project's partner schools. the team will also conduct quasi-experimental studies to determine i-act impact on teacher performance and quality of work-life."
"Collaborative Research: The Role of Information & Influence Campaigns in Structuring Public Responses to U.S. policy, 1988 - 2015","collaborative research: the role of information & influence campaigns in structuring public responses to u.s. policy, 1988-2015 there is a growing consensus that public debate has been transformed through the increased use of information and influence campaigns (iics) by a range of organizations to affect political decision-making around a variety of nationally important issues. this research aims to explain the extent and impact of these strategic communications campaigns. to do this, the project: (1) maps which organizations participate in specific national issue debates; (2) conducts an extended analysis of communications tools and tactics used in public contexts for purposes of influence; and (3) examines the viewpoints and motivations guiding the actors who carry out these activities. the project considers the political contests and the coordination of resources among a wide variety of actors, including corporations, trade associations, research institutes, regulatory bodies, advocacy organizations, and governmental and non-governmental organizations over a 27-year period from 1988-2015. this research supports efforts to increase the role of the behavioral sciences in the federal government's policy development and implementation. this research informs policy makers about the complex processes of interaction that are part of the design and development of policy, and thus contribute to policy makers' ability to better engage businesses and the public in the development and implementation of government policy. it also contributes to multiple areas of research in sociology, political science and media studies. the overall objective of this research is to critically inquire into the extent, influence, and impact of professional advocacy campaigns on debates in the public sphere. the research will explain the extent and impact of strategic communications campaigns on political and public responses to specific policy efforts. to achieve this goal, the project maps the organization of one specific public policy area and analyzes the factors that influence its shape over time. the researchers conduct an extended analysis of communications tools and tactics used in public contexts for purposes of influence. the researchers also carry out extended field observations and interviews to develop a situated understanding of the viewpoints, motivations, and schemes guiding the actors who carry out these activities. combining methods from sociology and communication studies, the researchers will (a) apply a macro-level network analysis to map which organizations have been featured in this issue arena between 1988 and 2015, what functions they serve, and how media and government forums help to establish each organization's level of prominence and legitimacy; (b) gather organizational characteristics to define and analyze the factors that drive the nature, extent, and impact of professional advocacy in this issue area (meso-level analysis); (c) conduct semi-structured interviews and observations at major industry events to assess the motives and rationales of the actors who create information and influence campaigns in this issue arena (micro-level analysis). the research contributes to understanding how social networks and institutional arrangements shape participants' understandings and thinking about policy issues. the research can assist scholars, policy advocates, and policymakers in developing better communications strategies that target particular publics and lead to more efficacious policy development."
Collaborative Research: Using Web Data to Study Campaigns and Representation,"electoral campaigns are a defining feature of democratic polities-they influence voters' choices and set expectations for how elected representatives will serve their constituents. yet, studying campaigns and their effects is difficult. this is particularly true when it comes to situations where numerous elections are taking place in a single country at one time. in this project, the pis build on data that have been collected since 2002, analyzing large samples of candidate websites and conducting surveys of candidate campaigns. these data provide a holistic picture of a wide range of campaigns-both winners and losers-and offer scholars and citizens the ability to assess what campaigns do, why they do it, and how it might relate to subsequent governing. the intellectual merit to the project is that the data will allow scholars and citizens access to unprecedented data about how those looking to represent the populace behave and the type of discourse they employ. the broader impact is that the enhanced understanding of campaigns that these data will provide will enable practitioners to identify sources of political change and discuss reforms that could ultimately improve campaign quality. the project also will involve students who will learn how to conduct research and be able to use the data in their own work. in the united states, citizens choose their representatives in part based on campaigns. yet, campaigns are difficult to study as they involve so many candidates, many of whom run relatively low-cost, small campaigns. one way to obtain a representative sample of campaign discourse is to rely on candidate websites since virtually all candidates have websites. websites also are ideal insofar as campaigns view them as holistic portraits of messages aimed at voters. since 2002, the pis have coded campaign websites and conducted surveys of campaigns. the result is an unprecedented data set of campaign behavior over-time. in this project, the pis will extend that data into the upcoming election, which is of particular interest given increased affective polarization and incivility, and the nationalization of elections. the intellectual merit to the project is that it will allow scholars and citizens access to data about how those looking to represent the populace behave and the type of discourse they employ. further, it will enable scholars to track the evolution of the internet and technology over time, and test theories of campaigns and their effects on voters and representatives."
Collaborative Research: Video Communication Technologies in Survey Data Collection,"this research project will examine data quality, participation, respondent experience, and costs in two promising but not yet widely deployed survey modes that use off-the-shelf video technology and are less costly than face to face (ftf) interviews: video-mediated (vm) interviews (live two-way communication via platforms like skype) and video self-administered (vs) interviews, in which video-recorded interviewers ask the questions and respondents answer by typing or clicking. this project will compare these measures of data quality and costs in vm and vs interviews carried out by the same professional interviewers and in conventional online (textual) self-administered questionnaires, asking the same survey questions to members of a representative sample who are randomly assigned to one of these three modes. because vm is synchronous and ""live"" like face-to-face (ftf) interviewing, and vs is asynchronous and recorded but still projects a human face, the project's comparisons will provide new insights regarding how these decomposable aspects of human contact affect behavior and experience in surveys. the project's results will reveal the extent to which, and for whom, less costly interaction (live but remote vs. recorded) with an interviewer promotes engagement and data quality comparable to what is found in similar ftf interviews. more generally, the findings will address when and in what ways modern communication modes that reduce social presence and are less personal might be equal to or even more effective than ftf interaction. findings from this project will provide valuable information relevant to the future of survey measurement and will be of interest to survey researchers in the federal statistical system and other survey organizations. even as survey data continue to be central to public policy and decision-making, survey measurement is challenged by declining response rates, increasing costs, declining trust in survey organizations, and rapidly changing communication habits among the public. understanding how video technologies could fit into the future of survey data collection is important both because it may meet potential respondents ""where they live"" and because it may provide a significantly lower cost alternative to ftf interviewing. there is even the potential to reach some members of the public whose location makes ftf interviewing difficult or expensive, but who may well be able to participate in a video interview (e.g., people who live in remote rural areas or members of the military deployed overseas). in comparing data quality across these three survey modes, the project will quantify participation rates, connectivity problems, respondent compliance with the video interviewing protocol, conscientious responding (giving precise answers to numerical questions, thoughtfully differentiating answers), and disclosure of sensitive information. the project will measure the potential impact of individual interviewers, feelings of engagement with the interview, rapport with the interviewer, and respondent satisfaction. the project also will allow assessment of data collection costs across these modes. access to and use of video technologies are not universal, and even among those with access some are willing to engage in video interaction while others are reluctant. the project will begin to address whether and how the effects of video technologies on survey data collection differ for participants with different levels of prior experience and preference for using the technologies."
Collaborative Research: Deep Inference - Artificial Intelligence for Structural Estimation,"in order to evaluate the effect of economic policies such as extended health care coverage or changes in the minimum wage, economists use structural models which powerfully describe the mechanism at work, but estimating structural models is typically challenging. a main tool for estimating such structural models is inference via simulation. for different parametrizations of the model, synthetic data is generated via the model, and the parameters generating data that most closely resembles observed data are used as estimates. recent modern artificial intelligence methods such as deep learning for image recognition are based on this same principle. these methods have been achieving impressive results over the past years. therefore, this research takes advantage of such powerful tools in modern pattern recognition for structural estimation in economics. this research considers a set-up where individual outcomes are a known function of exogenous variables and an error whose distribution is known up to a finite dimensional vector of parameters. the goal is to estimate the finite dimensional parameter. the investigators adopt the generative adversarial network approach (gans) to find the parameter value such that given a discriminator, a device that can accurately distinguish data generated using the model from real data, is unable to do so when the data is generated according to such parameter value. the method developed in this research differs from other simulation-based minimum distance estimators in that the distance is adaptive. that is, the discriminator learns the features of the data that are best at distinguishing real from synthetic data as opposed to hard-coding what features of the data to match. this adaptability property has proven powerful in pattern recognition tasks. in structural estimation, adaptability can translate into alleviating the curse of dimensionality, and obtaining parameters that are able to more closely match entire distributions of data, as opposed to a set of pre-specified moments. this estimation framework should be useful in applications were distributional effects and heterogeneity are first order to evaluate the effect of a particular policy."
Collaborative Research: State Variation in Mass Incarceration Reforms,"after years of increasing incarceration in the united states, recently many states have passed reforms aimed at reducing their prison populations. however, not all states have embraced reform of their incarceration rates and policies. this project will examine what has led some states but not others to initiate new policies that could reduce rates of imprisonment. consequently, this project takes advantage of the shift in national context and the new variation in state level reforms to assess how states create or impede significant reforms of their incarceration policies. the project will examine legislative incarceration reform efforts in several states between 2000 and 2016. to do so, the project will use a paired case study comparison design. three sets of state-pairs in different geographical regions will be matched on theoretically relevant variables known to correlate with penal policy and incarceration rates. the matched state-pairs design allows for variation in extent of reform. data for the project will include archival and legislative documents, media content, and interviews. de-identified data from the project will be made publicly available. in this way, the project will help determine why some states have enacted incarceration reform, while others have been impeded in doing so. the project also will help identify effective strategies, resources, and processes with the most potential to better understand unnecessary incarceration within different state contexts."
Collaborative Research:  Empirical Models of Supracompetitive Pricing in Differentiated Products Markets,"this research studies the magnitude and determinants of prices and price-cost margins, with lessons for merger enforcement and the detection of cartels. most empirical research assumes prices are determined by firms' product portfolios, the extent to which consumers view products as differentiated, and, importantly, competition based solely on current market conditions. however, when firms expect to compete in the future and have sufficiently low discount rates, threats of future price wars can support higher prices than predicted by static pricing models. this project explores this theory in two ways. first, the investigators develop and estimate a repeated game model of oligopoly price leadership. the assumptions in the model are motivated by an industry practice where one firm proposes a markup to a coalition. the model is then used to understand how mergers change pricing incentives. second, the investigators develop a test of static competition that is robust to how exactly firms set prices under the alternative hypothesis. this research illustrates both methodologies with empirical applications. this research characterizes equilibrium in the price leadership model, state conditions under which marginal costs can be recovered given data on prices, quantities, and demand estimates, and characterize conditions under which firms' implied time preferences can be identified. the investigators apply the model to the u.s. brewing industry and study how the miller/coors joint venture changed pricing incentives. the test for static nash competition takes into account product differentiation and multi-product ownership by individual firms. this test is applied to the u.s. canned tuna market, where two of the three largest firms recently plead guilty to price fixing. this research shows how the framework can be used to i) date cartel operations, ii) distinguish cartel participants from firms that are simply pricing optimally given its competitors are colluding and iii) study the effectiveness of the cartel by comparing observed prices and variable profits to those that arise in nash-bertrand equilibrium and under joint profit maximization."
"Collaborative Research: Railroads and the Growth of American Manufacturing: Evidence from Complete Counts of the Census of Manufacturing in 1850, 1860, 1870, and 1880","manufacturing in the united states rose to global economic prominence in the 19th century along with the spread of the national railroad network. this research examines the impacts of railroad network expansion on manufacturing productivity growth, using data from the united states census of manufacturers. the united states census of manufacturers collected detailed information on every manufacturing establishment in the country in 1850, 1860, 1870, and 1880. the investigators are collecting these establishment-level data and assembling digital images of the handwritten census manuscript pages. the investigators are then entering these data to be made publicly available for use by others and for their own research on the development of american manufacturing. the preliminary analysis from this research, using county-by-industry tabulations of the census of manufacturers data, suggests that an expanding railroad network led to substantial economic gains by increasing manufacturing activity in productive areas that were less accessible by natural waterways. these preliminary estimates suggest a central role for transportation infrastructure in supporting economic growth. the investigators extend this analysis to draw in important ways on the new establishment-level data from the census of manufacturers, allowing for impacts of expanded access to markets on firm markups. this research further estimates the impacts of improved access to markets on firm technical efficiency, as innovation incentives may increase along with the extent of the market. the investigators also explore the efficiency of allocation of resources across firms in this period, in contrast to the modern united states and modern developing countries, and estimate whether the efficiency of allocation of resources across firms improved with increases in market connectedness."

Collaborative Research: How Policy Affects Power Plants in an Age of Experimentalist Governance,"this project tests the effects of various policies on the emissions and water usage of power plants. in addition, it investigates how the effectiveness of these policies is affected by countries' income distribution, entrepreneurial activity, government centralization, and concentration of utility assets. this study uses data compiled by the iea and the world resources institute. findings from this project promise to advance the field of policy research and especially our understanding of consequences of the rapid diffusion of policy instruments around the world. by determining how national conditions such as entrepreneurial activity weaken or strengthen the potency of policies, results also can aid government decisions about which evidence-based programs are best suited for promoting a particular nation's health and welfare. data for this project comes from merging the wri's newly created power watch dataset on the emissions and water usage of over 20,000 power plants in 190 countries (2004 to 2014) with the iea's database on domestic policies. the following hypotheses are tested: 1) policies are more likely to decrease emissions in countries with less inequality, 2) policies are more effective in settings that strongly support entrepreneurial activity, 3) policies on use and policies on effects work less well together within moderately centralized governance systems, and 4) policies are more apt to increase the emissions and water consumption of plants when the plants are owned by companies that dominate domestic electricity markets. this project provides new evidence on the effectiveness of individual policies, but also sheds light on their trade-offs and the circumstances under which they are more and less compatible."
Collaborative Research: Robust Inference and Computational Methods for Optimal Values of Nonlinear Programs,"empirical research in the social sciences often entails estimating and drawing robust inference about optimal values of nonlinear programs. examples include, but are not limited to, the analysis of causal effects of economic policies; features of the distribution of counterfactual outcomes (e.g. optimal reserve prices and optimal revenues) under weak assumptions; counterfactual vote shares and seats assignments; welfare effects of policy interventions; demand extrapolation and welfare analysis subject to rationality constraints; maximum and minimum responses to monetary policies. this research aims at establishing a general, formal framework and providing a methodology for estimation and robust inference on optimal values of nonlinear programs under weak restrictions on the underlying process that has generated the observable data. recognizing that the computational feasibility of the method is crucial for its applicability and usefulness for empirical researchers and society more broadly, the investigators deliver algorithms for computation of the proposed estimators and robust confidence intervals. this research also delivers a collection of portable computer programs implementing the methodology that will be shared with the community openly and free of charges or restrictions. this research aims at developing robust inference procedures and computational methods for parameters in econometric models that are characterized as optimal values of nonlinear programs. making inference on such functionals is nontrivial because subtle features of the underlying optimization problem may affect inference. for example, the optimal solution may not be unique, may be unique but only weakly identified, or may be characterized by intricate constraints. due to these challenging features, existing methods often impose assumptions such as constraint qualifications on the underlying optimization problem. these are hard to verify in practice. this research aims at developing inference methods that place very little structure on the optimization problem. further, the project aims at developing and investigating the convergence properties of a computational method that can be used to implement the procedure. nonlinear programs often involve black-box functions that are computed by simulation or by solving a complex structural model. the algorithm developed in this project, which is based on the response surface method, mitigates the computational cost by constructing flexible approximations to such functions and adaptively drawing evaluation points to regions that are highly relevant for finding the optimal value."
Collaborative Research: Establishing Norms of Data Ethics in Citizen Science,"citizen science refers to a broad spectrum of ways in which scientists and members of the public collaborate in scientific discovery. though the phrase ?citizen science? is relatively new, members of the lay public have been involved in with citizen science activities for centuries. nevertheless, the current scale and rate of growth of citizen science, often mediated by digital communication technology, is a new phenomenon. millions of people globally contribute to science through citizen science projects, often facilitated by mobile phones equipped with gps, apps, and cameras. increasing numbers of teachers and youth educators are introducing citizen science to children, and increasing numbers of professional scientists and research institutions are incorporating citizen science into their research programs. citizen science has been rapidly spreading around the world and across disciplines. it is typically funded outside traditional institutions and conducted without the traditional regulatory oversight mechanisms that exist in institutions such as universities. this project will address these issues and the resulting ethics gap within citizen science. the project will focus on an issue common across nearly all citizen science projects - voluntary data collection and use, which presents an important ethical tension between confidentiality and openness. this research will involve: (1) identifying and encouraging ethical research by citizen scientists; and (2) building capacity within the citizen science association to establish and maintain an ethical framework for this newly emerging form of organizing science work. the project is organized around a three stage, mixed-methods research design to investigate current and ideal ethical practices in citizen science and to use human-centered methodology to create an ethical culture of citizen science through collaboration with the citizen science association. these outcomes will be achieved by: (1) creating an inventory and typology of data collection practices; (2) employing a mixture of surveys, interviews, and focus groups to determine the views of practitioners and volunteer data collectors on the ethics of data collection and management; (3) creating a guide for best ethical data practices; (4) disseminating tools for ethical practices in data science; and (5) assessing the use and efficacy of these tools and best practice trough the creation and dissemination of a quantitative survey of the ethical culture of the citizen science association."
Collaborative Research: Participatory Technology Assessment and Cultures of Expertise,"this award supports a research project that studies efforts to democratize expertise in the context of federal agency decision-making. it investigates whether and how participatory technology assessments have change expert cultures at nasa, noaa, and doe. very little is known about how participatory technology assessments, which are public engagement exercises where different stakeholder groups (including citizen organizations, state systems, and non-government agencies) interact with technical scientist and technical expert groups, impact agency decision-making processes and the ways that technical experts think about lay citizens. the case studies of federal government agencies and their participatory technology assessment practices that are to be developed in this project have the potential to inform how numerous types of technical experts plan and implement such assessments in practice; it will result in practical lessons learned for improving future collaborations. beyond academic publications and conference presentations, the results of this study will be used to develop a best practices handbook for effective collaboration between boundary organizations that specialize in public engagement and government agencies. results will be presented at the arizona state consortium for science policy outcomes seminar series in washington, dc, which has a long history of engaging local and federal agencies, ngos, and academics interested in the practical application of research. this research project will use a combination of in-depth interviews and document analysis to assess whether and how participatory technology assessments lead to reflexive changes in expert views on public input and knowledge, including how experts perceive and implement public engagement practices in decision making. the research team has access to technical expert decision-makers in the u.s. federal government context. as a result, the study will be able to address fundamental knowledge gaps in the public engagement and expertise literature. it will provide a comparative, applied account of federal agency expert reflections on their participation in the adoption, framing, and implementation of participatory technology assessment and the integration of assessment results into decision-making processes. it will bring to light how particular federal agency experts and expert groups are influenced by and challenge the assessment process, and it will explore the extent to which such assessments serve the role of a reflexive learning device for technical expert decision-makers. it may also serve to substantiate existing theories in the public engagement and expertise literature that merely postulates improvements in decision making processes and techno-scientific cultural change through public engagement exercises."

RUI Collaborative Research: Measuring the Long-Term Effects of California's 2004 Paid Family Leave Statute with U.S. Tax Data,"paid family leave has been championed as a policy to reduce labor market inequality and narrow the gender gap in wage earnings. california was the first state in the nation to enact a paid family leave statute effective in july 2014, but data have limited strong conclusions about the policy's impacts. this research uses novel, large-scale internal revenue services (irs) tax data to understand how california's paid leave policy affected parents' careers and family structure over its first decade in existence. this research uses large-scale administrative irs tax data to quantify the effect of california's 2004 paid family leave statute on the short and long-term labor-market and family outcomes. the sample consists of the universe of tax-filers allowing the investigators to follow individual mothers and fathers from 2001 to 2015, link to their children's exact date of birth using data from the social security administration, and examine changes in labor market outcomes in the short-term (less than 1 year after her first birth), near term (1-5 years after birth), and long-term (6-10 years after birth). in addition, this research examines changes around first birth before the policy change took place as an internal validity check. for both mothers and fathers, the investigators provide novel evidence of how the 2004 paid family leave statute has impacted labor-force attachment, employer transitions, and wage growth. in addition, the investigators study how the statute affected family structure, including both marital stability and childbearing."
Collaborative Research: Understanding the Creation and Mission Content of Non-Governmental Organizations,"this project will examine the creation and mission content of non-governmental organizations [ngos] based in the united states. the project will enhance basic understanding about when, why, and how entrepreneurs make strategic decisions to enter the non-profit market, and the consequences of these choices for social welfare outcomes. the project will have a broader impact by assisting current and potential non-profit leaders to make better decisions regarding when and how to create new organizations. the research from this project will be disseminated through targeted publications, a public website, and a workshop. the study will also contribute to education and research infrastructure. specifically, it will develop datasets about ngos based in the united states that will be made available to other researchers, including extensive qualitative materials from several ngo sectors. it will have an important educational benefit by training undergraduate and graduate students and generating classroom resources. the goal of this project is to develop and test theory about variation in ngo creation and mission content. it asks questions such as: when and why are ngos created, and for what purposes? despite the practical and theoretical importance of non-governmental organizations, scholars have given little systematic attention to when ngos are founded and the purposes for which ngos are created. this project combines theory from multiple disciplines to enhance knowledge of organizational creation, examining ngos over time and across different sectors. the proposed project offers two key advances. methodologically, the project employs experimental and qualitative methods to complement traditional observational, quantitative approaches to organizational creation. theoretically, the project examines mission content and innovation in ngo creation, building on previous work to examine new outcome variables. the proposed research involves three principal types of original data collection and analysis. first, a statistical analysis of coded ngo mission statements will enable the study of dynamics among a large number of real-world ingos, promoting external validity. second, a survey of ngo practitioners will enhance the study's internal validity by integrating an experimental component. moreover, it will enable the testing of the individual-level observable implications of the theoretical framework. and third, qualitative case studies of the evolution of several ingo sectors will explore the processes by which sectors develop and change. this multi-pronged research strategy is guided by a recognition that the study of organizations benefits from analyses at multiple levels and using multiple methodologies. cutting across all prongs of the research design is a commitment to studying ngos in diverse sectors of activity to promote the study's generalizability."
Collaborative Research: Bayesian Estimation of Restricted Latent Class Models,"this research project will advance statistical methods known as cognitive diagnosis models (cdms). cdms are the statistical machinery that link cognitive theory with applications in online learning technology. they serve as a framework for providing fine-grained classification of the skills and attributes needed for success in the classroom and beyond. robust cognitive theory is central to ensure accurate inferences with cdms. this project will develop new statistical methods for validating cognitive theory in the context of cdms. the modern classroom generates a wealth of longitudinal information from computerized student assessments. the innovations from this project will provide a framework for human development that harvests the available information to track skill development and to support teachers' instructional decisions in real time. the new methods will be applicable more broadly to other disciplines, such as the social sciences, neuroscience, medicine, and business, as an approach to gain more detailed and nuanced information about cognitive processes underlying human judgment and decision making. software developed during the course of the project to implement the developed procedures will be made publicly available. the project will advance statistical and psychometric theory by developing bayesian methods for estimating the q matrix for a general class of models. cognitive theory will be incorporated into cdms by specifying a q matrix that catalogues the skills required by each task. the general unavailability of cognitive theory q matrices for most content areas and research domains poses a barrier to widespread application of cdms. the project will offer several advances to existing research. the project will develop procedures for estimating q for the most general restricted latent class model. bayesian estimation methods will be employed that explicitly enforce identifiability conditions to ensure consistency and accuracy of parameter recovery. stochastic processes and irreducible transitions will be created to estimate q when the number of latent attributes is unknown a priori. the project also will consider methods that incorporate expert knowledge in the statistical model to improve estimation of q and to enhance interpretation of uncovered attributes. psychometric insights gained from working on this important problem can lead to significant developments in the underlying statistical theory for estimation of cognitive diagnosis model q matrices and could potentially have an impact on the broad spectrum of applications beyond education and psychology, such as machine learning applications that seek to cluster binary data according to a set of underlying features."
Collaborative Research: Non- and Semi-Parametric Modeling of Structured Human Activity Patterns Using Point Processes,"this research project will advance theory and methods for analyzing structured human-activity data. because of recent technological advances, large amounts of real-time human-activity data, such as social media data and transaction data, are being collected by various sources. the complexity and magnitude of these new data call for new statistical modeling tools. the methods to be developed in this project are motivated by and can be used to further understanding of human behaviors. through active interdisciplinary collaborations with domain experts, the project will establish a bridge between the statistics community and the behavioral finance and social science communities. open-source r packages will be developed and made available for public use through cran. key materials from the project will be incorporated into the advanced graduate student courses. the investigators will develop a series of new non- and semi-parametric point process models for temporal point patterns of structured human activities. in particular, they will develop (1) a multi-level functional principal component analysis framework for modeling human activities such as stock trading etc.; (2) a simultaneous modeling and clustering approach for daily human activity patterns that are not only structured but also heterogeneous across different sub-populations; and (3) a new class of bivariate point process models to model the complex behaviors of modern social media users and provide meaningful insights into a user's content generating behavior. for the first two aims, popular functional data analysis tools will be introduced to model point processes with complex structures. efficient computational algorithms will be developed and theoretical properties of these algorithms will be investigated. for the third aim, a semi-parametric regime-switching multi-type point process model will be used to model social media posting behaviors, where the posting intensity functions are approximated with spline basis functions."
"Collaborative Research: Network Sovereignty: A Comparative Study of Local Network Initiatives in Rural, Low-income Communities","this project will advance understanding of the importance of local ownership and culture when developing telecommunication networks in rural, low-income, indigenous communities. using the concept of ""network sovereignty"" as an analytical framework, the project investigates how varying degrees of network ownership, design involvement, and technical knowledge can impact and empower marginalized communities and result in networks that are more useable and sustainable. by engaging with research in areas of critical infrastructure studies and technological literacy and by leveraging strong local partnerships, the project will build a model for understanding how telecommunication network development can best be organized to support diverse, low-income, rural communities. a particular contribution will be to convey the importance of local cultural practices to network innovation and adoption, and to describe the enabling conditions and long-term effects of such processes. there is common assumption that low-income, rural communities can benefit economically from their integration within telecommunication networks, but there is a tendency to neglect how important issues of local community deliberation, ownership, design, and culture are to such processes. when telecommunication networks are extended to ""last mile"" communities, how involved are members of these communities in such processes? how important is the local ownership and control of network facilities? how do local community members understand and make sense of their network integration? what do they hope to gain from such technological developments? and how have communities addressed these issues in different ways? to answer these questions researchers employ a collaborative ethnographic approach and conduct fieldwork and interviews in three diverse communities that have formed local network initiatives. case studies include rhizomatica in oaxaca, mexico, oki communications in the blackfeet indian community of browning, montana, and the serengeti broadband network in the mara region of tanzania. researchers will partner with community organizations to explore the emergence and relative success of these local network initiatives and, at the end of the project, will provide an analytical framework for evaluating such initiatives in other communities. the project also includes a workshop that enables community partners to discuss and share best local network practices with one another."
Collaborative Research: Comparing Single- vs. Double-Blind Review of Scientific Abstracts for Accuracy and Bias,"this research project will conduct a field experiment to compare double-blind and single-blind review processes in a high-stakes selection process. peer-review is used to identify quality scientific work and as such is the mechanism by which the scientific community regulates itself. science, however, does not take place in a vacuum. the possibility of bias from known characteristics such as gender, name, title, or nationality has led to frequent and recurrent calls that the evaluation of scientific work should follow a double-blind review process (where the identities of both the reviewers and the authors are withheld) rather than a single-blind review process (where the identities of the reviewer are withheld but not the authors). yet, there are strong arguments for the use of single-blind review, including that it is difficult to truly conceal the identity of the authors and that their identities may serve as a valid cue for the quality of the work. the project will compare the outcomes from single- and double-blind reviews of talks included on the program of a national conference. the experiment will examine how well each review process predicts highly rated talks (accuracy) and whether the reviewers show preferences for author characteristics unrelated to talk quality (bias). the project will provide evidence-based recommendations for review procedures that facilitate an efficient, fair, and impartial review process. the project also will help develop methods to insure underrepresented groups have an equal and fair chance in other fields where peer review plays an important role in the research selection process, such as science, technology, engineering, and math. graduate students will play an integral role in the conduct of this research. this research project will compare the effects of single- and double-blind review processes on conference submissions to the upcoming 2018 annual meeting of the society of judgment and decision making in a large-scale field study. the project will examine the degree to which characteristics such as gender, name, title, country of origin, and institution influence evaluation of conference abstracts in a high-stakes selection process. the project also will examine the impact of the use of these cues on evaluation accuracy. all abstracts submitted for a paper presentation will be subject to both single- and double-blind review. this will allow a direct comparison of the two review processes controlling for heterogeneity between papers. the accepted talks at the annual conference also will be evaluated for their quality and attendance to determine which of the two review methods better predicts these outcomes. no published study has compared actual outcomes of different review processes. reviewer ratings will be modeled not only using the characteristics of the submitting author, but also the features of the topics in the submitted abstract, thus allowing for comparison of how different review processes impact the judgment processes of reviewers. the investigators will use the results from this large-scale field experiment to develop evidence-based recommendations for review procedures that facilitate an efficient, fair, and impartial review process."
Collaborative Research: Examining Compliance with Rights Regimes,"title: collaborative research: examining compliance with rights regimes abstract: the protection of human rights, including women's rights, is a cornerstone of economic development, social progress, and the promotion of peace around the globe. while numerous international institutions seek to protect women's rights, it remains unclear if, when, and how these institutions can effectively safeguard women?s rights. understanding the processes by which political leaders and citizens mobilize around international women?s rights laws and institutions is critical for improving the efficacy of these institutions. accordingly, this project will focus on state compliance with international human rights rulings and recommendations on women's rights issues. this project will examine the rulings and recommendations of the european court of human rights, the un committee on the elimination of discrimination against women, and the un universal periodic review that are handed down to european states on issues of women's rights. as well, the research will draw on interviews and case studies in denmark, the netherlands, norway, and spain, each of which has strong democratic institutions but varying levels of compliance with international women?s rights institutions? recommendations. the project will create and disseminate a new dataset on women's rights recommendations, the women?s rights recommendation digital database, which will be used for a battery of statistical tests to identify the factors that affect compliance with international women's rights recommendations. the database, statistical analyses, interviews, and case studies will provide insight into the macro-level factors that impact the effectiveness of women?s rights institutions and the processes behind compliance with international women's rights recommendations."
Collaborative Research: Meta-Analysis of Empirical Estimates of Loss-Aversion,"losses hurt more than gains feel good. this principle, known as ""loss-aversion"", is a foundational principle in behavioral economics, which uses psychology to improve economic prediction and advice. loss aversion is applied to understand several policy issues, including international trade and stock market trades. it has also been used as a tool by governments and businesses to design ""nudges"" to help people make better decisions. the value of ""loss aversion"" depends on specific events and circumstances in which it is applied. as a result, several calculated values of loss aversion exist, creating confusion and uncertainty for its use in research and policy. this proposed research will collect all calculated values of loss aversion, categorize and summarize, and placed them in a central repository for easy reference. the results of this research activity will improve the usefulness of loss aversion in research and policy development. this will establish the us as the global leader in loss aversion research and application as this will be the only such study in the world. aversion to losses is measured by a number ""lambda"", which is thought to be about 1.5-2 times higher than the value of gains. this range of values is based on prominent examples, but there are actually several hundred published studies measuring ""lambda"". our proposed meta-analysis involves finding and identifying every paper that has a statistical estimate of ""lambda"", recording all those estimates, then summarizing their results. scientists can then see for the first time whether the assumed range of ""lambda""=1.5 to 2 is correct. the proposed research will also measure how much ""lambda"" varies for different groups of people and based on differences in scientific methods (e.g., controlled lab experiments vs. inferences from everyday decisions). this evidence can help behavioral insights teams customize nudges for particular groups of people, using more precise assumptions about the appropriate value of ""lambda"". the meta-analysis also illustrates how to cumulate scientific knowledge effectively, to overcome possible concerns about the reproducibility of science. this research also contributes to the efforts to increase reproducibility of scientific research."
Collaborative Research: Transgenerational Mobility,"this project investigates the effects of grandparents on the outcomes of their adult grandchildren, independent of parental influences. correlations due to genetics and family culture that may confound these effects also are taken into account. this will give a more thorough analysis of social mobility than that obtained solely on the basis of parent-child relations. this project will enhance the well-being of society by increasing understanding of the degree and pattern of intergenerational transmission of disadvantages and advantages in key sociodemographic outcomes, which affect the well-being of individuals, families, and society as a whole. this project eliminates bias due to unobserved multigenerationally-correlated endowments through use of data on five generations available in the utah population database and an innovative modeling strategy. causal effects of parents and grandparents on children are assessed across six major sociodemographic outcomes: schooling attainment, occupation, age at marriage, age at first birth, number of children, and age at death. the project makes four contributions. first, models of multigenerational relations that incorporate controls for unobserved multigenerationally-correlated endowments will be developed and estimated. second, measurement error biases will be reduced by including more complete sets of members of each previous generation, up to great-great grandparents, than in prior studies. third, the effects of sex of children and of maternal versus paternal lineage on multigenerational effects will be analyzed. finally, the importance of cross effects, that is, effects of including many parental and grandparental sociodemographic variables, and the extent to which they reduce analytical bias will be investigated."
Collaborative Research: Long-Term Effects of Unconditional Cash Transfers to the Poor,"governments engage in short-term income and wealth transfers to individuals and households to alleviate poverty. the viability of this approach depends on the long-term effects of such transfers. however, little is known about the long-term effects of such short terms income transfers on several outcomes including education, work and income, asset accumulation, and health; and what form an effective short-term transfer might take. this proposed research will use field experiments to study the long-term effects of a one-time unconditional cash transfers to low income families on several outcomes, including health, income and wealth. this research will answer two questions: what are the long-term effects of one-time income transfers on recipients? do the effects depend on whether the transfer is unconditional or conditioned on the recipients behaving in certain ways? the researchers will compare outcomes of families that received unconditional transfers to those of households that did not receive transfers as well as those who received the same amount of transfers but with conditions attached. the results of this research project will help improve the us government's transfer program and in the process, reduce poverty. the research results will also be used as inputs into formulating and implementing us aid policies. finally, the results of this research will establish the us as the global leader on reducing poverty through one-time income transfers. governments around the world engage in redistribution of wealth and income in response to economic fluctuations and poverty. the long-term effects of such policies on economic, social, and political behavior is therefore of policy importance. this project will provide a first-of-its-kind analysis of the long-term effects of a large-scale infusion of wealth on outcomes on recipients. the project builds on a large-scale experiment conducted by an ngo, givedirectly (gd), which makes unconditional transfers to poor households. starting in 2014, gd randomized among a sample of 653 villages to receive these transfers and ""treated"" 11,000 households to receive $1,000.00 each in the selected villages. an initial end line survey was conducted in 2016-2017, with the median survey conducted 10 months after transfers were delivered. this research will collect and analyze data in a second end line conducted about 3 years after the transfers were delivered. the measurement encompasses a wide range of outcomes including asset holdings; consumption; income; business revenue; subjective well-being; health status; education; female empowerment; food security; and labor supply. the results of this research project will help answer whether one-time cash transfers have significant effects on recipients and whether such effects depend on the transfers being unconditional or conditional. the results will also establish the us as the global leader in poverty alleviation through short-term income transfer programs."
Collaborative Research: Cognitively costly decision making by economic agents: micro and macro implications,"this award funds research in macroeconomics. the team starts with the observation that many and possibly most economic decisions require time, attention, and careful reasoning. in other words, economic decisions require a specific kind of work called cognitive effort. however, most standard approaches used in macroeconomics assume that people can make their economic decisions instantaneously, with no effort. the research team will develop and analyze a new and tractable model of an entire economy where people, firms, and institutions find that reasoning requires costly cognitive effort. the model allows for the possibility that individuals, businesses, and policymakers may make economic decisions that are not in their long-run best interest simply because determining the best action takes too much time and effort. this is consistent with results from behavioral science. the new model may give us new tools to predict the effects of economic policies, and therefore could contribute to u.s. economic growth as well as advancing fundamental knowledge in economic science. the cognitive limitations studied in this project are not about agents imperfectly observing the relevant state variables such as interest rates, prices, and tax rates. instead, the focus here is on agents imperfectly computing actions such as hours worked and how much to spend and save. the standard approach in macroeconomics focuses on issues created by imperfect observation and assumes a mapping derived under full rationality. the approach taken in this research is consistent with experimental evidence. formally, the research starts with the assumption that agents observe the objective states but do not know their optimal policy function. they therefore make rational decisions about how to expend costly cognitive resources to learn about the policy function. the team will first develop a tractable static framework of individual behavior. the key emerging property is that as information accumulates about the unknown policy function, the optimal reasoning choice makes agents' effective actions state and history dependent, leading to non-linearity, endogenous persistence, and volatility clustering. the non-linearity generates both inertia to small shocks, and a salience like effect for large shocks. the second project extends the theoretical analysis to a dynamic setting where agents fully anticipate how current reasoning choices impact future utility and choices. the third project sets the mechanism in a representative agent macro model and studies its aggregate implications, where the non-linear features of the micro behavior are likely to re-surface in aggregate outcomes. there the cognitive limitations that affect individual decision rules as well as the preception of general equilibrium effects are jointly analyzed. the fourth project introduces heterogeneity and incomplete markets."

Collaborative Research: Religion-Related Bias Victimization: Addressing a Blind-Spot,"evidence suggests that crimes targeting individuals based on their religion are on the rise. this harms not only the well-being of victims, but also the well-being of their communities and the nation. existing data assessing criminal victimization and bias-motivated crimes do not adequately measure the religion of victims or the role of religion in bias-motivated crimes. this project will provide new data by conducting a nationally representative survey of adults to assess their experiences with victimization and whether they perceived that religious bias was a motivator for their being victimized. this project will provide much-needed information to assist law enforcement, communities, and policy-makers in better preventing religion-related crimes and serving the victims of such crimes. the project will field a survey using a nationally representative sample of 1,000 us adults along with oversamples of several minority religious groups totaling 1,200 additional respondents. the survey instrument will utilize both original questions along with questions drawn from existing surveys. the instrument will measure individuals' experiences with criminal victimization with a specific interest in whether religion was perceived to be a motivator for the offender(s) and the impact of the experience on the victim. the project will augment the survey data by attaching indicators from the u. s. census that reflect community characteristics such as racial composition and median household income. use of the 2010 religious congregations and membership study will permit attaching data on the religious composition of respondent neighborhoods. the data generated from this survey will be analyzed using regression models predicting outcomes such as the risk of victimization, fears of victimization, and the impact and responses to victimization. findings will inform theories in several sociological subfields including the sociology of religion, criminology and collective action."
Collaborative Research:  Payoff-Belief Separable Preferences,"this project builds a bridge between the frontier of behavioral economics and mainstream applied economic analysis. the team analyzes and tests a model of individual economic decisions. in this model, the beliefs of consumers, workers, and investors directly impact their individual well-being. the research builds a unifying framework that includes many widely used models from behavioral economics as specific cases. the team develops testable implications that can be used to determine whether the models accurately describe individual behavior. they will use these to test the new theory in a series of laboratory experiments. the model they propose is an alternative to the standard model of utility maximization that is almost universally used when economic science is applied to understand or predict economic outcomes. as a result, the new theory could bring frontier insights from psychology, decision science, and behavior economics to wide adoption in mainstream economic analysis. this kind of analysis is widely used by state and local governments, the us federal government, and business. as a result, the project could improve economic policies and the ability of businesses to compete in the marketplace. the project uses decision theory to enrich the study of preferences that depend both on material outcomes and intermediate beliefs. the team introduces and analyzes a new class of dynamic preferences to capture a general additively-separable approach to belief-based utility. this class encompasses many models already developed in behavioral economics. models of belief-based utility have demonstrated important implications for the design of medical tests, the analysis of how investors rebalance portfolios, and other important applications. providing new, simple, and testable conditions to distinguish between different belief-based motivations for economic decisions will help us to better understand how psychological processes affect economic decisions."
"Collaborative Research: Evictions: Causes, Consequences, and Institutions","this research studies the mechanisms through which eviction and housing instability affect low-income families. eviction is a frequent source of housing instability among the urban poor, and recent research suggests that it is a key factor limiting the upward mobility of american families. yet existing evidence on the consequences of eviction is based on comparisons of evicted tenants to similar non-evicted tenants, making it difficult to isolate eviction as a root cause of urban poverty rather than a symptom of other causes such as job loss or deteriorating health. this research contributes to the existing body of evidence by evaluating the causal effects of eviction on three sets of outcomes: household relocation, financial health, and children's educational outcomes. the investigators use linked administrative data on eviction court cases, outcome data after the court ruling, and a quasi-experimental design. in addition to estimating the causal impact of eviction, this research provides new descriptive evidence on the common pathways into eviction, information on the population facing eviction, and the types of financial stresses that precede an appearance in eviction court. this research investigates the causes and consequences of residential eviction for low-income american families. the investigators assemble a novel dataset on over 700,000 eviction court cases from cook county, il, and link these cases to several administrative datasets, which allows them to measure: (1) household relocation, including neighborhood choice, household composition, and homelessness; (2) financial health, including employment, earnings, public assistance receipt, and access to credit; and (3) children's educational outcomes, including school switching, disenrollment, absenteeism, academic achievement, and behavioral incidents. this research uses a quasi-experimental research design to identify the causal impact of eviction on these outcomes. for identification, the investigators leverage the random assignment of judges to eviction cases, along with variation in leniency across judges. this research uses linked credit data and administrative data to study the population appearing in housing court, the evolution of financial strain in the run-up to eviction, and whether the consequences of eviction differ by the sources of financial distress, contrasting negative shocks from more gradual declines in financial health."
"Collaborative Research: Measuring Attention, Working Memory, and Visual Perception To Reduce Risk of Injuries in the Construction Industry","human error (e.g., poor decisions or unsafe actions) are a main casual factor in up to 80% of all workplace accidents across a breadth of industries. to the extent our limited capacity for information processing capacity is a major source of such errors, better understanding of cognitive processes will yield more effective methods for predicting and reducing the poor decisions that put workers at risk. accordingly, this study will complete a series of eye-tracking experiments to build an error-detection framework - the human-error detection framework - that computes the likelihood of human error in occupational settings to enable proactive countermeasures to keep workers safe. subsequently, to extend the value of this framework, this project will enrich and expand research-based educational materials, outreach, and engagement activities to spread awareness about this framework to communities and workers. to achieve these goals, this multidisciplinary project blends research linking eye movements and workers' attention with research focused on working-memory load and decision making in order to discover how and why workers in dynamic work environments fail to detect, comprehend, and/or respond to physical risks. using the dynamic and high-risk environment of construction as a testbed, the proposed framework will connect eye movements and cognitive manipulations in laboratory and field experiments with worker demographics to identify precursors that predict accident-causing human errors in dynamic worksites. in all, this project will demonstrate the value and effectiveness of synthesizing cognitive psychology, engineering, and advanced computation to improve decision making and occupational safety. the human-error detection framework will harness real-time eye-movement patterns to identify human errors and thereby lay the foundation for synthesizing technology with data analysis to automatically identify and interrupt human decision-making errors before injuries occur. using the predictive models resulting from this study will not only contribute to significant accident reduction but will also provide a critical validation measure to confirm the effectiveness of training programs in enhancing workers' risk-analysis skills. furthermore, since this project provides tools and insights for researchers, students, and workers to use to enhance occupational safety and multidisciplinary research, this project will evolve the broader pedagogical landscape of the decision, risk, and management sector. as this innovative research challenges the conventional, reactionary paradigm of safety-risk management by enabling the identification of at-risk workers using a measurable indicator of their cognitive processes, i.e., their eye movements, the proposed proactive approach to occupational safety has the potential for averting occupational accidents across industries and thereby will foreseeably prevent the injuries that undermine the well-being of millions of american workers and their families."

Collaborative Research: Pennsylvania Solitary Confinement Study,"the u.s. penal population is the largest in the world, but imprisonment in america is also distinguished by its extensive use of solitary confinement, defined as incarceration in a cell for 23 hours each day with limited access to visits from outsiders or rehabilitative programs. solitary confinement is an important but understudied part of the experience of punishment in the united states. the scant available evidence suggests solitary confinement is associated with poor health and adjustment to society after incarceration. the current project, the pennsylvania solitary confinement study (pass), will analyze conditions of penal confinement and their effects on health and well-being, labor force participation after prison release, and recidivism. the project will provide a multidimensional account of the conditions and effects of extreme confinement in a large u.s. prison system. the project will also improve our understanding of how solitary confinement is used, and how it may have significant and long-lasting effects. a key broader impact of the project is to enable a research-driven national policy effort to reevaluate the use and policies of solitary confinement. quantitative studies of the effects of solitary confinement have relied on observational data to estimate weakly-identified causal effects. the current project will use detailed statewide prison records (2007-2017) to estimate causal effects of solitary confinement on long-term outcomes, exploiting the random assignment of hearing examiners to prison misconduct cases. it combines field surveys of incarcerated men and prison staff in a solitary confinement unit with a quantitative state-wide analysis of administrative prison records. the longitudinal survey data collection combines an analysis of prison records, a survey and neurocognitive battery administered to incarcerated men (n=117, including a main sample of 99 and a pretest sample of 18) recently admitted to solitary confinement and then three months later, and interviews with prison staff (n=22). analysis of this quasi-experiment will yield estimates of the effect of solitary confinement on employment and recidivism. because prior research on solitary confinement has been based on clinical interviews with small samples often in the context of litigation, the survey extends research by collecting data at scale with a standardized instrument. survey responses at two points in time allows a comparison of the conditions of solitary confinement with the general prison population. thematic analysis of interview transcripts will illuminate the relationship between prisoners and staff and shed light on the mechanisms by which solitary confinement produces long-term impacts. the proposed study will contribute new data and analysis for policymakers and scholars seeking to understand and address the conditions of penal confinement in the united states."
Collaborative Research: The Dynamics of the Capital and Labor Allocation in the United States,"this research project measures how capital, labor, and other inputs are allocated across manufacturing firms and establishments by size, age, and other characteristics. they will use data from the department of treasury and the u.s. census bureau to calculate statistics that describe how these resources have been allocated across u.s. manufacturing firms, and how that allocation has changed over time. the new measurements will be publicly available and will be used in models of the u.s. economy. the team also plans to use a business cycle accounting procedure to assess whether (and to what degree) changes in resource allocation help to create business cycle fluctuations. finally, they will identify a set of economic frictions that are important for understanding business cycles. a large class of macroeconomic models starts with the behavior of individual firms, aggregates firms into industries, and then builds up to the production side of the entire us economy. the result of this project will be widely incorporated into these macroeconomic models. as a result we will better understand how government economic policies affect different industries and firms in different ways. the team seeks to understand the role of frictions to resource allocation in shaping business cycle fluctuations. they will provide a publicly available set of reduced-form statistics that describe the dynamics of the allocation using high-quality census micro data. second, they will develop a semi-structural distributional business cycle accounting procedure to assess the contribution of changes in the allocation to aggregate fluctuations. third, they will use the results of this procedure to identify the set of structural frictions that are quantitatively relevant for understanding aggregate fluctuations."
Collaborative Research: An Expanded Framework for Inferring Public Policy Diffusion Networks,"general summary state governments are commonly referred to as ""laboratories of democracy?""because for many decades they have experimented with new policy solutions to society's most important problems. public policy scholars and practitioners of politics often look to the states for innovative policies that can be emulated by other governments across the country; a process referred to as policy diffusion. however, the complex relationships between the states (that is, the patterns, pathways, and mechanisms underlying how policies actually diffuse from one state to another) are not well understood. in this research, the pis develop innovative tools and data to facilitate the large-scale computational and data-intensive study of policy diffusion. they seek to develop and utilize the largest database on states' decisions to adopt policies to better understand which states are policy leaders, which are policy followers, and why. this will provide a novel, expansive, and systematic view of the policy diffusion process that covers the american states. as a result, policymakers and other interested stakeholders will have access to a comprehensive look at the spread of innovation among state governments regarding financial, environmental, health, security, and other social problem domains. technical aspects this research seeks to make three central contributions to the study of public policy diffusion. first, it will produce a database on the adoption of hundreds of policies in the american states, at least tripling the size of the largest database currently available and yielding a sample of policies that is more representative of the universe of policies for which states make laws. it will also leverage these new data to map and analyze the network pathways according to which policies diffuse (i.e., establish states that are leaders and followers in the diffusion of policies). as recently published research by the principal investigators shows, cutting-edge computational methods can be applied to large databases containing information on when policies were adopted by which governments in order to identify underlying networks along which policies persistently diffuse. another key contribution from this research is to improve upon the existing method for inferring network ties in ways that are most suitable for policy diffusion research (as well as social science more generally) and implement it in a user-friendly package in the r statistical environment. a final contribution, which is intended to maximize the potential user-base of these data and methods, will be to build an interactive online portal to the data, complete with visualizations and automated analytics."
Collaborative Research: Using Computer Vision to Measure Neighborhood Variables Affecting Health,"this project will develop an automated method, using advances in computer science, to observe and record systematically the physical conditions of neighborhood environments at a large-scale. neighborhood environments play a significant role in shaping the health of individuals and communities, consequently contributing to inequality in the u.s. past research suggests that the presence of physical disorder, poorly maintained properties, and vacant lots in neighborhoods can negatively affect physical and mental health, attract more crime and disorder, and lead to neighborhood disinvestment. the measures resulting from this study will facilitate examination of these processes and provide a powerful resource for the scientific research community. they will be more broadly beneficial as well by allowing policymakers, practitioners, and the public to track neighborhood progress and target improvements. the project takes advantage of google street view imagery--the largest publicly available longitudinal dataset of visual appearance of street blocks--and will use amazon's mechanical turk--a crowdsourcing platform--and existing field survey data to identify indicators of physical disorder and maintenance, such as trash and blighted buildings, on a sample of street segments across three distinct cities: boston, detroit, and los angeles. these data will be used to train an algorithm that draws on recent advances in machine learning and computer vision. reliability and validity of the method for identifying characteristics and measures will be tested throughout each step of the process. the resulting longitudinal measures of the physical conditions of neighborhoods will be linked to longitudinal health surveys conducted in each of the three cities to analyze the relationship between physical neighborhood conditions and health. in addition, the new measures will be released as a publicly available database of longitudinal measures of physical neighborhood conditions across multiple cities."
"Collaborative Research: Prices, Peers, and Perceptions: Field Experiments on Technology Adoption in the Context of Improved Cookstoves","adoption of potentially welfare-improving technologies remains frustratingly low in many contexts. improved cookstoves are a prime example: while cleaner-burning stove technologies have potential health, environmental, and social benefits, efforts to disseminate these technologies have fallen short and the practice of cooking with biomass over open fires remains dominant throughout much of the developing world. the central aim of this proposal is to study how economic incentives (""prices""), social learning (""peers""), and subjective beliefs (""perceptions"") interact to influence technology adoption dynamics. we do so through a field experiment that offers new stoves at different price levels to groups of households with and without social ties to households that have already received stoves. our results will inform and future efforts to disseminate welfare-enhancing technologies to larger population groups. our conceptual model of households' technology adoption and use decisions highlights multiple potential interactions among prices, peers, and perceptions. key research questions that will be addressed through our experiments include how price affects perceived quality of a new technology, how these perceptions are modified by exposure to peers that have experience with the technology, and how perceptions change over time based on one's own experience and (objective and subjective) technology performance. we implement a novel identification strategy for identifying these effects, using the preexisting and exogenously controlled distribution of free stoves in combination with uncorrelated, cluster-randomized assignment to different stove subsidy levels. by explicitly measuring perceptions in conjunction with other outcome variables in the experiment (including both surveys and physical indicators of stove use and impacts on personal exposure to pollutants), the researchers will be able to test specific models about how prices and peers (prior adoption interact in belief formation) a key issue in the technology adoption literature."
Collaborative Research: Evaluation of ACA Reform,"at the core of the affordable care act (aca) is the ""individual mandate"" law. under this law, each individual in the aca's ""health insurance exchanges"" needs to buy coverage or pay a penalty. individual mandate has perhaps been the most controversial part of the aca. this research aims at answering two crucial questions about this law. first, by how much would the uninsurance rate increase after lifting individual mandate? second, to what extent could the proposed replacements to this law mitigate the negative impact of that lift on coverage? this research develops an economic model of healthcare exchanges that incorporates asymmetric information and consumer dynamics. it allows for heterogeneity in health statuses of individuals, enabling it to capture adverse selection -- the main reason why the market could collapse without individual mandate. the model is dynamic, allowing it to capture consumers' foresighted decision making. this is crucial for evaluating the impact of the proposed replacements to individual mandate, which all penalize consumers who stay uninsured today with restricted access to health insurance in the future. using the model, the investigators examine how different ways to replace or reform the aca might affect the performance of the health insurance exchange and the consumer welfare."
"RAPID: Collaborative Research: Role of Extending, Expanding, and Emergent Groups in Relief Distribution Efforts in the Aftermath of Hurricanes Harvey, Irma, and Maria","responding to large disasters and catastrophes is an extremely difficult endeavor. this challenge is a direct consequence of the devastating effects that disasters can produce on societies. these effects impact all facets of the socio-technical processes at the core of modern life. disaster mitigation, preparedness, and response plans must be improved to minimize vulnerabilities, and to ensure that what is known can be leveraged to improve the effectiveness of future efforts. disaster logistics should be a whole-society effort, where the civic and public sectors participate to minimize the negative impacts of disasters. disaster researchers have already established that the civic society plays a major role in all aspects of the response to extreme events, from search and rescue and relief distribution, to rebuilding efforts. they are often credited with being the first respondents due to their proximity to the impacted area. these groups are a very heterogeneous collection of formal and informal organizations with different structures and levels of expertise in disaster response. previous field work has also shown that the civic society can provide effective response to their communities by means of leveraging their connections to access logistical resources and efficiently respond to the disaster. frequently, these groups delivered relief supplies faster, and more effectively, than any of the large relief organizations. on the other hand, the activities of some groups can prove troublesome, such as the gathering of donations of non-priority supplies. the reality is that the majority of the donations that arrive at a disaster site are non-priority goods that severely complicate disaster response efforts. the main goal of this project is to identify lessons, both positive and negative, that the disaster community should learn from the experiences of the civic society during the responses to hurricanes harvey, irma, and maria. identifying these lessons will help future disaster responders to conduct more effective operations, and reduce the impacts of disasters on local communities, the economy, and the environment. this project studies the socio-technical factors that hamper the integration of non-established relief groups (nergs) efforts and that of relief efforts that come from the outside to help. in addition, the research provides crucial knowledge about the role that nergs play in the humanitarian logistics, and about how best to structure the interactions among the established groups, the official response and the nergs, for maximum effectiveness. the data collected about the difficulties of relief groups to deliver supplies will help identify mechanisms to prevent these problems from happening in future disasters. the research documents the logistic structures that emerge in support of relief/early recovery efforts after a major extreme event and enable future model development based on these different relief approaches. the findings enhance theoretical understandings of organizations participating in these extreme event environments. the research focuses on both formal and informal mechanisms through which nergs identify, gather, deliver, and distribute relief items. data collection includes short and informal as well as in-depth interviews with individuals involved in the logistics efforts, at all levels of action (e.g., international, national, re-gional, local, and community levels), from nergs, and at all levels of power. in order to gain better understandings about the motivations behind physical donations, the team creates a directory of donation drives taking place across the us to support the relief efforts. the goal is to conduct longitudinal tracking of their operations, and perform in-depth studies of how these efforts are created, their evolution, and their decision-making patterns. this effort serves as the basis for more in-depth behavioral research. the researchers promote multidisciplinary collaboration, engages undergraduate and graduate students,and disseminate and integrate research findings into disaster courses. improving humanitarian logistics operations can reduce human suffering and loss of life in disasters"

"Collaborative Research: RAPID: Hurricane Response, Governance Structures, and Public Higher Education","public universities face many challenges in their efforts to operate within an environment that is both dominated by political influences and subject to the pressures of market-based competition for necessary resources. disasters magnify the challenges of managing within this environment, especially when the institution is constrained in its ability to accommodate the unique needs of students who are facing significant difficulties after a natural disaster. the short term disruption caused by a disaster can lead to long-term consequences for public institutions, but many of these more pronounced consequences may not be fully attributable to the effects of the disaster, but instead may be a function of the inability of policy frameworks and administrative structures to adapt to the needs of public institutions and policy beneficiaries after extreme events. especially important are the financial consequences of enrollment loss and the constraints that come with accreditation structures. this study will use administrative interviews and data on student success to examine the role of policy design in post-disaster decisions and its influence on student success. we hope that our findings will motivate discussions among federal education officials and accreditation organization leaders about the ways in which they may consider options that would enable institutions to better support students in their efforts to rebuild their lives and pursue their educational goals. theories of publicness, political control, policy implementation, and the politics of attention mostly speak to the challenges faced by public sector leaders in times of relative stability (not in response to extreme events), and many discussions of disaster response are limited to elected officials and/or federal agencies. this project seeks to examine how these dynamics play out in disaster recovery efforts for public higher education institutions and their students. we will use a mixed methods design, with qualitative interviews of administrators and a quantitative analysis of student data. the study site is lamar university in beaumont, tx. the administrative interviews focus on the ways in which efforts to accommodate and support those affected by the storm were influenced by accreditation-related constraints (in this case, from the southern association of colleges and schools) and concerns about the effects on funding streams (tuition revenue, state appropriations, and federal financial aid). the quantitative analysis examines how the decisions immediately following the storm affected student enrollment and persistence and the extent to which these effects vary by student-level risk factors or level of storm damage for the individual's household."
Collaborative Research: High-Performance Computational Standards For Redistricting,"general abstract this project develops computational tools that objectively evaluate redistricting plans, and automate the creation of redistricting plans to satisfy particular criteria selected by users. the tool will provide a mechanism for decision-makers to use when negotiating redistricting plans, eliminating the inherent bias that arises when the data and the ability to propose plans are available to only a few political interests. the project will entail multiple elements, namely: formulate the redistricting problem as a discrete optimization problem, introduce quantitative measurements to score maps on a wide set of criteria, create novel optimization algorithms customized for the redistricting problem to identify maps that score well on given criteria, and create a computational tool that allows states, individuals, and political parties to negotiate redistricting plans. in addition to the development of the computational tool, this project will engage in a detailed study of how to use computational models to shed new substantive insight and aid in the creation of fairness standards in the american redistricting process. such standards have been elusive despite decades of effort. the broader impact of the work seeks to transform the upcoming future redistricting rounds by opening it up to participation to a broader and more diverse group of stakeholders. likewise the tool will provide greater flexibility and enhanced capabilities for developing redistricting plans than ever before. in the research realm, the algorithm development will also be applicable to large-scale optimization problems that utilize massively parallel computing architecture. the project also contributes to graduate education, providing instruction about the application of computational approaches to an array of social scientific questions. technical abstract the contributions of this work span a variety of disciplines including political science, law, computer science, math, operations research, and supercomputing. in the computer science and supercomputing realm, the research will tune and enable a parallel genetic algorithm library to scale to hundreds of thousands of processors. the algorithm advances operations research heuristics for large combinatorial optimization problems. the implementation is a hybrid metaheuristic that combines the search capabilities of evolutionary algorithms with refinements for diversification and intensification to empower a more efficient and effective search process. the mathematical approach yields new quantitative measures of political phenomenon. in political science and law, the project will create a new ability to synthesize and analyze massive amounts of data that will yield new substantive insights about fairness standards for redistricting as well as the effect and impact of redistricting on the democratic process."
CRISP: Type 2/Collaborative Research: Design and Control of Coordinated Green and Gray Water Infrastructure to Improve Resiliency in Chemical and Agricultural Sectors,"scientists, along with the public and private sectors, are abuzz with the potential for ""green infrastructure,"" an approach for water management that protects, restores, or mimics the natural water cycle. this approach is economical: wetland construction or restoration can be far more cost effective than building a new water treatment plant. green infrastructure also lessens manufacturing risks, while it enhances community safety and quality of life. for example, restored wetlands would improve water reliability for manufacturers, create habitats and open spaces for wildlife, and dampen the risks of drought and floods on public water supplies. the big, unanswered question about green infrastructure is whether managers would be better able to control water systems if green infrastructure was coupled with traditional gray infrastructure, such as reservoir operations. modeling, data, and decision-support tools for blending gray and green water infrastructure, however, do not yet exist. this critical resilient interdependent infrastructure systems and processes (crisp) project advances a modelling framework that couples gray and green water infrastructure systems and processes. the project also incorporate the effects of economically motivated human players into the coupled system. specifically, this collaboration of scientists and water managers aims to minimize the impacts of extreme weather (drought and flood) on infrastructure processes in the chemical, petroleum, and agricultural sectors along the coastal basins of texas. this work leads to: (1) a knowledge exchange between water-rights holders and regulators, including between private and public-sector actors. (2) an online learning platform to disseminate project results into curricula to train corporate sustainability officers and river authorities. (3) training at least three graduate students, three postdocs, and many undergraduate students, including some from a minority-serving institution (texas a&m university at kingsville), and nurturing the collaboration between arizona state and texas a&m at kingsville universities. the big, unanswered question about green infrastructure is whether the benefits - improved base flow reliability, damped peak flows, local storage - might be better controlled by being coupled to traditional gray infrastructure, such as reservoir operations. modeling, data, and decision-support tools for blending gray and green water infrastructure do not exist at present. this project advances a control-theory framework that couples gray and green infrastructure subsystems and processes, and explicitly incorporates the effects of economically motivated human players into the system. the project framework minimizes the negative effects of extreme weather (drought and flood) on infrastructure processes in the chemical, petroleum, and agricultural sectors of the coastal basins of texas. the work includes an integrated analysis of grey infrastructure for water storage and conveyance along with green infrastructure that provides environmental and aesthetic benefits. although gray and green infrastructure are often intermingled, they are usually analyzed independently. for this integrated analysis, the engineering component is a model of ground and surface water interactions in both arid and humid regions in texas. the computer science aspect is a synthesis of coupled grey-green infrastructure systems and the generation of environmental service flows. the socioeconomic study is an application of competitive game theory that seeks to understand and augment water trading to promote in-stream flows from water rights that have been allocated for commercial, industrial, or municipal use. the project also includes visualization and stakeholder engagement in the application of water trading."
Collaborative Research: A Comparative Diagnosis of Policy Conflicts: Examining Unconventional Oil and Gas Development across the United States,"every society experiences conflict associated with government policy making. such conflict affects the capacity of governments to address societal problems. unconventional oil and gas development that uses hydraulic fracturing is one example of a contentious policy issue that is often associated with policy conflict. knowledge of the sources, characteristics, and effects of policy conflict around these contentious issues, however, remains underdeveloped. additionally, while conflicts around oil and gas development appear to be intense and growing, not all oil and gas policy issues are conflictual and not all conflicts are intense or intractable. therefore, this project explores differences across state-level policy decisions related to oil and gas development over the past decade in order to provide an understanding of how different policy contexts influence the intensity of conflicts and their outcomes. through this research, the proposed project advances scientific knowledge about policy conflicts. the new knowledge benefits stakeholders of unconventional oil and gas development, individuals interested in understanding how to diagnose and navigate policy conflicts, and scholars interested in theoretical approaches to policy conflicts. using a new policy conflict framework (pcf) as an analytical guide, the goal of the project is to provide conceptual and theoretical clarification about the factors that explain the variation in policy conflict intensity across policy decisions, along with the expected effects of policy conflicts and policy decisions related to the governance of oil and gas development. in doing so, the study tests newly developed hypotheses related to: 1) how the policy conflict setting affects the intensity of conflicts; 2) how the design of proposed policies affects the intensity of policy conflict; and 3) how the intensity of conflict affects the degree of changes found in proposed policies. the research also examines the distribution of the intensity of policy conflicts, and evaluates processes and outputs of policy decisions related to policy conflicts. the research methods involve identifying the population of all policy decisions around unconventional oil and gas development in state-level regulatory agencies and legislatures, and coding news media related to these policy decisions. then, the research team takes a sample from this population and uses interviews, surveys, and institutional analyses of policy decisions to collect key indicators of the sources, characteristics, and effects of conflicts. in applying the policy conflict framework, this proposed project builds generalized and localized knowledge about policy conflicts."
Collaborative Research: Police Department as Organizational Machine: Effects of Body Worn Cameras on the Work Dynamics and Performance of U.S. Police Departments,"the adoption of body worn cameras in us police departments represents a challenge to established ways of policing. this applies to law enforcement agencies as much as officers. for agencies, body worn cameras represent a novel piece of equipment that must be supported through appropriate technological systems and usage policies. cameras also produce an abundance of video data that policing organizations must manage as well. considering these demands, this project will identify the impacts of body worn camera technologies on individual work dynamics and organizational operations in us police departments. specifically, this project will develop a larger it governance framework to maximize the value of body worn camera technologies for effective policing operations. this project will expand knowledge on the management of public sector organizations that are increasingly enmeshed with wearable internet of things technologies like body worn cameras, and research results will inform the development of educational materials in technology management, law and criminology, and information systems. a primary goal of this project is to create an evidence-based organization theory and it governance framework for public sector organizations that are being increasingly embedded with digital technologies in general and internet of things technologies in particular. specific to the impacts of body worn cameras (bwc) on policing organizations, this project addresses three questions: (1) what individual work dynamics and organizational changes are induced by bwc systems; (2) what technosocial governance mechanisms help maximize the value of bwcs in accomplishing police departments' mission; and (3) what empirical evidence explains the effects of bwcs on the operational and mission performance of police departments. this research activity answers these questions through a three-stage research design. first, the investigators will complete qualitative case studies of police agencies by analyzing data collected from interviews, field observations, and document analyses. second, drawing upon the results of the case studies and in collaboration with participating agencies, the investigators will develop an it governance framework to maximize the value of body worn camera technologies in accomplishing police departments' missions. lastly, drawing from data that will be collected through survey and public sources, the investigators will analyze the effect of body worn cameras on the operational and mission performance of police departments across the us."
Collaborative Research: Signaling Prosociality: Harnessing Impure Motives to Help Others,"the question of how to facilitate pro-social behavior is one of the most pressing challenges facing behavioral scientists because answers to this question have far-reaching implications for a myriad causes of unhappiness. in many domains, such as vaccination, resource conservation, or blood donation, the outcome that is optimal for the group cannot be achieved unless individuals act beyond their narrow self-interest. the current research harnesses the principle of signaling to develop and test interventions that may inspire pro-social behavior by appealing to agents' desire to appear prosocial. whereas some people may be motivated to contribute to the public good simply by altruistic concerns for others, even absent those purely altruistic motives, nearly everyone likes to be viewed by others as a prosocial person or to think of themselves as prosocial. in economic terms, this idea is captured by the concept of signaling -- engaging in a behavior that signals the type of person one is. thus, a self-interested reason to engage in pro-social behavior is to signal (to oneself or to others) that one is a good person. five sets of experiments in the current project test the idea that prosocial behavior can be increased if people are given the opportunity to use that behavior to signal their prosocial nature. in the proposed research the investigators test the effects of interventions designed based on signaling theory for their influence on prosocial behavior in a series of field and lab experiments. first, a field study in the context of a blood drive tests whether monetary incentives motivate blood donation more effectively when framed in a way that signals the pro-social motives of the decision maker to perform the behavior. second, a study on framing messages to emphasize the signal value of vaccination examines whether parents of young children are more likely to receive an influenza vaccination for themselves after viewing a message presenting vaccination as a signal that one puts their children first than after seeing a message presenting vaccination as a signal that one puts self-care first, or after seeing either of two control messages. third, in a study on peer recommendation, researchers will test whether a message advocating blood donation is more effective if it emphasizes the signal value of this behavior, and whether this signaling effect is more pronounced when the message comes in the form of a personalized recommendation from a co-worker as compared to a standard message from a blood drive. fourth, three studies on social comparison will investigate whether feedback comparing one's performance to that of others promotes performance improvement in a pro-social task because the social comparison feedback serves as a signal, indicating what the performance says about the agent. fifth, in a series of studies using a common pool resource game, researchers will explore the effect of a partitioning manipulation that signals the equitable amount for each agent to consume into order to achieve the group optimal outcome, and they will test whether the partition serves as a coordination signal. this research extends previous work in economics, social psychology, and decision research, and it applies signaling theory to the design of interventions to facilitate pro-social behavior. the body of research combines powerful field experiments with tightly controlled laboratory experimental designs to test the efficacy of signaling interventions by assessing actual behavior and examining the decision processes underlying these effects. the findings will simultaneously shed light on the nature of both pro-social behavior and signaling mechanisms."
RIDIR: Collaborative Research: Analytical tools for text based social data integration,"when something happens in the world -- such as a natural disaster, an election, a protest, or a policy change -- many types of media record different accounts of the same event. newspapers, social media posts and government documents all provide unique versions of events stored in different formats. because each source provides its own perspective, synthesizing these stories vastly increase our ability to learn about both events and the dynamics of the media environment. yet, social scientists are limited in their capacity to access these myriad perspectives because there are few tools for automatically combining these accounts into one integrated analysis. this project will provide a rich infrastructure for integrating texts from diverse sources documenting the same social phenomenon. such integration often reveals much about underlying social dynamics. this project will develop a tool to integrate documents with different formats with accounts of the same or closely related events through four main methods. first, the tool will allow users to align documents by topic, while accounting for structural and stylistic differences between documents. second, the tool will compile different types of documents by a shared event or entity. third, the tool will allow for user-provided schema to combine semi-structured documents. last, the tool will facilitate data fusion, by identifying and resolving contradictions from multiple sources. the tool will be sufficiently flexible to fit multiple research purposes, allow for human feedback to assist with integration, and facilitate reproducibility by creating a common resource that can be the basis of future research by a whole community of scholars. the system itself will be applicable to almost any set of unstructured text data and will have broad applicability for questions across the social sciences."
Collaborative Research: Institutional capacity as an organizational challenge: a field experiment in Pakistan,"abstract vyborny collaborative research: institutional capacity as an organizational challenge: a field experiment efficient management of organizations---businesses, governments or non-profits--is central to economic growth and development. although there have been some studies of organizational efficiency in businesses, few have studied organizational efficiency in the public and non-governmental sectors---sectors that are becoming increasingly large shares of modern economies. this research will use a unique field experiment, involving a large donor organization and over 800 recipient community organizations, to study the efficiency in large, multitiered and complex organizations with emphasis on how information flowing through the organization is used, and how to effectively incentivize agents to achieve the organization's goals. this research will seek to answer three major questions: (i) can a transparent self-reporting tool and non-monetary incentive scheme motivate community organizations to achieve their goals; (ii) how do parts of a large complex organization respond to and use new information they receive; and (iii) how does the response to new information depend on the characteristics of the organization? the results of this research will lead to improvement in the performance of large, complex organizations generally. efficiency in these organizations will improve the performance of economies worldwide. large organizations face challenges in managing information, setting incentives and delegating decision-making power to the relevant personnel. existing empirical work investigate incentive problems in private organizations. however, limited attention has been paid to the performance of large non-profit and government organizations. this project will use a unique field experiment to address three issues---information and communication within organizations, divergent preferences within organizations, and performance of non-government organizations. the experimental design will allow the pis to test three main ideas: (i) can community organizations be incentivized through self-reporting and non-financial rewards to improve their performance; (ii) how does each part of a large, complex organization respond to new information on performance indicators; (iii) do the responses of management and workers to the receipt of new information and incentives depend on organizational characteristics of the organization, communication costs between parts of the organization, and decentralization of decision making authority? to answer the first question, over 800 recipient community organizations will be surveyed and then randomized into different self-reporting schemes using a two-by-two factorial design with controls. this design allows the pis to test for the impact of self-reporting on service delivery or governance. to answer the second and third questions, the pis will carry out a novel revealed-preference ranking experiment involving both junior and senior management staff members. the results of this research will strengthen our understanding of the determinants of efficiency in organizations and in the process, contribute to increased efficiency of economies worldwide."
Collaborative Research: Multilevel Regression and Poststratification: A Unified Framework for Survey Weighted Inference,"this research project will develop a unified framework for survey weighting through novel modifications of multilevel regression and poststratification (mrp) to incorporate design-based information into modeling. real-life survey data often are unrepresentative due to selection bias and nonresponse. existing methods for adjusting for known differences between the sample and population from which the sample is drawn have some advantages but also practical limitations. classical weights are subject to large variability and can result in unstable estimators, while regression approaches present computational and modeling challenges. the new framework developed by these investigators will allow adjustment for selection bias and nonresponse as well as improvements in design-respecting inference. using this approach, survey analysts will be able to properly account for non-ignorable design issues in the regression framework, and practitioners who conduct surveys in government, academic, commercial, and non-profit sectors will be able to construct statistically efficient survey weights in a routine manner. this new framework may be applicable to problems resulting from the newly emerging explosion of ""big data,"" such as integration of surveys from multiple sources, analysis of streaming data, and respondent-driven sampling. the project will develop software that can be accessed by the general research community. this research project will connect survey weighting with poststratification under the framework of mrp. in mrp, data are partially pooled during the modeling process and then local estimates are combined via poststratification to obtain the population inference. this smoothed estimation borrows information from neighboring poststratification cells and allows flexible multilevel modeling strategies that have the potential to be robust to model misspecification. the project generalizes mrp to handle weighting adjustments for regression, deep interactions, calibration for non-census variables, complex survey design, multistage sampling, multiple survey frames, and other complications that arise in real-world survey analysis. the new methods will be applied to two ongoing surveys, the new york longitudinal poverty measure study and the fragile families and child wellbeing study. computations will be performed using the open source bayesian program stan and will be freely disseminated. the project is supported by the methodology, measurement, and statistics program and a consortium of federal statistical agencies as part of a joint activity to support research on survey and statistical methodology."

RR:  EAGER Collaborative Research:  Building Dynamic Research Communities in Global Legal Studies,"comparative and international legal approaches provide the foundation for future scientific innovation. complex legal frameworks are increasingly offered as the solution to the most pressing issues of our time. the issues transcend borders, levels of governance, and areas of policy expertise demanding coordination, collaboration, and convergence to create sustainable institutional solutions to these pressing societal needs. this project pilots a new model for collaborative and convergent research communities in law and social sciences. the project aims to form the critical connections, commitments, and institutionalization to ensure a transformative change in how research on comparative and international law is designed and implemented, and how the findings and data from the research are disseminated. to date, lack of transparency, limited accountability, poorly-sustained graduate mentorship, and an absence of a commonly-accepted platform for data sharing have led to a fragmented field and a large number of single-use data projects. in turn, this has hampered the ability to sustain research agendas resolving salient legal questions. the project develops three collaborative components: data infrastructure, idea labs, and an annual research workshop. together, these institutional innovations will ensure the reproducibility, replicability, and generalizability of data in the field of law and social sciences, and they will create a new multidisciplinary and interdisciplinary collaborative team model that is better equipped to embrace the complexity and scope of global legal challenges."
Collaborative Research: How Military Service Shapes STEM Trajectories,"the project will advance scientists' understanding of stem career trajectories by exploring the historical and contemporary role of the u.s. military as a potential career pathway. specifically, the project analyzes the impact of educational benefits associated with military service (gi bill), plus the role of individual and workplace factors on people's educational and occupational outcomes. thus, the project addresses recurrent calls from the federal government and national academy of sciences to increase the number of stem professionals, diversify the stem workforce, and optimize the recruitment of military personnel. findings from this project will help social scientists identify the long-term effects of policies and workplace dynamics on degrees and occupations. findings will promote national defense and our ability to train the next generation of stem scientists, because employers (from departments of defense and commerce, veterans administration, to private-sector) are interested in hiring individuals with a military background, many of whom are poised to work in technical/defense fields and classified environments. findings also will inform efforts to broaden stem participation and identify potentially unanticipated consequences of federal policies designed to broaden access to higher education. the project addresses the following questions central to scientific literatures on education and occupations: how does military service and the educational benefits associated with it shape individuals? subsequent training and employment in stem fields? how have era of service and changing gi bill benefits affected stem trajectories among veterans? how do organizational factors associated with specific military branches facilitate entry into stem fields? how does using competing definitions of stem fields employed by federal agencies affect the form and magnitude of the above patterns? to answer these questions, the project employs statistical analysis of publically available secondary data from the american community survey (acs) and department of defense demographic reports. the result will be a newly merged public-use data set available to researchers that combines census data with organizational data on the armed services. analyses involve sophisticated statistical models on large samples: for instance, analyses of occupational trajectories include more than 5 million acs respondents, including more than 700k veterans. acs data also facilitate analysis of educational and occupational patterns among active-duty military personnel, who potentially constitute a prime target population for recruitment into stem fields. the project also makes a methodological contribution by examining how various, competing ways to operationalize and measure ""stem"" used by federal agencies shape conclusions about the scope and extent of the much-discussed shortage of stem workers."

Collaborative Research: Dimension Reduction Methods for Estimating Economic Models with Panel Data,"a vast empirical literature has demonstrated that firms, workers, schools, or banks differ from each other, and that accounting for agent heterogeneity in economic models is often key for accurate quantitative predictions. this project develops new techniques to capture relevant sources of heterogeneity which are not directly observed in the data, but can be inferred using repeated observations of individual choices or other outcomes. flexibly modeling unobserved differences between agents with individual-specific parameters raises important challenges in terms of computation and statistical inference. the approach developed in this project is based on dimension reduction methods whereby heterogeneous agents are grouped into a small number of types. discrete methods provide a way to reduce the dimensionality of heterogeneity. this may be advantageous for both computational and statistical reasons. however, existing methods such as finite mixtures face computational challenges, and they are mostly studied under the strong assumption that heterogeneity is discrete in the population. the investigators broaden the scope of discrete methods, by developing computationally tractable two-step estimators and studying their properties in the absence of such substantive assumptions. this research also illustrates the usefulness of these methods in applications, particularly in structural models where allowing for unobserved heterogeneity raises important challenges, and in models with two-sided heterogeneity."
Collaborative Research: Reform and Governance in Engineering Education,"this project addresses the ways in which the structure of the engineering profession, and its institutional makeup, both enable and limit efforts to shape and reshape engineering education as practiced within the united states. the study is both historical and contemporary. it examines the broad history of the different ways in which improvements and regulations have impacted engineering education, from the early progressive era educational reform traditions built around surveying and reporting on best practices, to the latest form of accreditation regime built around student learning outcomes. in addition to exploring the historical origins of these different approaches to governing engineering education, the project will interview engineering educators, educational policymakers, and professional engineers in order to understand policymaking and accreditation functions within contemporary institutional settings. the project will contribute to understanding stem workforce development by providing engineering educators and policymakers with the ability to better shape and control our system of engineering education. this will have broad impact on our ability to effectively train a skilled stem workforce in an increasingly competitive global arena. in pursuing this work, the project both draws on and contributes to a diverse literature, including but not limited to those of the sociology of the professions, organizational sociology, and the sociology of science and engineering. using interview methods as well as historical records, this project will assemble precise descriptions of the ways in which different institutions and stakeholders engage those occupying different positions within engineering professional societies; licensing bodies; accreditation agencies; and engineering education institutions (public and private universities; general universities, engineering schools, and embedded stem programs within liberal arts colleges and minority serving institutions). formal techniques for analyzing the interview transcripts (content analysis) will be utilized to bring forth accurate characterizations of how different players both contribute to and navigate through the complex institutional ecology for engineering education in the united states. this formal understanding will be instrumental to the effective governance of engineering education in the us context."
Collaborative Research: A Unified Approach to Spatial Economics,"in the past few years, trade economists have begun developing general equilibrium models where country size and distance play a crucial role in the determination of the equilibrium trade relationship. this research aims at advancing the understanding of general equilibrium spatial models, with special emphasis on their policy implications. the investigators first construct an integrated spatial framework encompassing a large number of general equilibrium economic models in which many locations are connected through one or more spatial linkages (e.g. trade, commuting, spatial knowledge spillovers). this project further develops new tools to characterize both the theoretical and empirical properties of the equilibrium of such models and optimal policy in these setups. lastly, the investigators apply the framework and tools to address a number of important policy questions such as: what are the economic impacts of infrastructure investment projects; how should one best design location-based policies within cities and communities; and what are the effects of shocks on the evolution of economic development across space? the scope of this research comprises six projects: (1) an analysis of the positive properties and comparative static implications for trade and geography models with a single spatial linkage; (2) an analysis of the positive properties of the equilibrium of spatial models with an arbitrary number of spatial linkages; (3) a characterization of the optimal use of land within chicago using an urban model in the presence of spatial knowledge spillovers; (4) a characterization of the optimal transportation infrastructure improvements within the united states; (5) a quantification of the importance of path dependence in the evolution of the u.s. economy over time; and (6) an analysis of the welfare implications of immigration policy. these projects have the potential to contribute to the advancement of knowledge in a number of ways, including: (1) it helps to integrate the fields of trade, economic geography, and urban economics by providing a single unified framework suitable for the study of many types of spatial interactions; (2) it offers a general characterization of the positive properties of spatial equilibria; and (3) it develops new tools to conduct the empirical analysis of spatial models on real world economic phenomena and characterize optimal spatial policies."
"Collaborative Research: New Applications of Dynamic Games with Asymmetric Information: Mergers, Capacity Discipline and Price Rigidity","this research investigates how asymmetric information between firms can affect prices and consumer welfare, and how antitrust policies might be changed to account for these effects. currently almost all analyses of markets -- whether to quantify market power or perform counterfactuals -- assume complete information, in which all firms know the demand, the marginal costs and the objectives of their rivals exactly. however, if firms know more about their own positions, then they might try to use their pricing or capacity choices to influence what their rivals believe in order to affect how those rivals might behave in the future. some simple examples suggest that even small amounts of asymmetric information can distort prices significantly, and potentially explain why prices rise significantly after mergers; why prices appear rigid even when menu costs should be small; and, why some industries, such as airlines, appear to go through periods of capacity discipline. this research will make theoretical, empirical and methodological contributions. the investigators first characterize non-collusive markov perfect bayesian equilibria in multi-period oligopoly pricing, bidding and capacity choice games with asymmetric information. the project further develops computational methods to solve such equilibria, which often require solving very large numbers of differential equations. the associated code will be made available to other researchers. the investigators also test and calibrate the models using scanner data on consumer packaged goods and data on capacity investments in airline markets. in addition, the project analyzes changes in prices and firm behavior around actual mergers to understand whether asymmetric information can explain why outcomes were significantly different from what the antitrust authorities expected when the mergers were approved. lastly, this research trains graduate students so that they can use these and other techniques in their own research."

Collaborative Research: Modeling Sample Selection for Multi-Level Data Structures,"general abstract an important part of political science research entails the analysis of events data in which the researcher accounts for when events occur, how often they occur, and tries to explain why they occur. examples of interest to political scientists include topics like wars, mass protests, and coups, for instance. one of the problems associated with this type of research is that the event being observed is the product of a number of other factors or conditions. as a consequence, the researcher may not be able to identify the actual causes or the relative contributions of a set of causal factors for that outcome. since the analysis of particular events is of such interest to political scientists, it is important to develop methods that allow researchers to draw the correct conclusions about how such events came to occur. the research team proposes to develop a statistical method to overcome the problems associated with events data analysis. the method has the potential to improve our understanding of how important types of events come to occur, making it of great interest to scholars across a range of social sciences. the research project will also provide a significant educational component as the team proposes to involve undergraduate students in the research experience. technical abstract the pi's note that much of the events data collected in the social sciences is the product of a structural data generation process that generally remains unanalyzed. as a result the observed events are correlated with a number of covariates. statistical analyses of such data may lead to biased inferences if not appropriately addressed. these problems are of particular concern for small-n, or area-based research. the pi's propose to develop a theoretically-informed, statistical approach to how data is selected structurally. the project consists of three components. first, they develop an estimation procedure for repeated observations at higher levels of analysis with structural data. second, they will produce work that bridges different periods of time-based aggregation across levels. third, they extend the structural selection frame to move beyond two-level structures. successfully developing the procedure will help to improve the collection and analysis of data, thereby helping to reduce the trade-off between thick descriptive approaches focusing on a few cases and thinly-informative operationalizations of variables in large-n studies. the work will have applications beyond political science, appealing to scholars in a number of social scientific disciplines. the project will provide important pedagogical benefits as the pi's will involve undergraduate students in the research."
Collaborative Research: Mass Media and Representative Democracy,"general abstract this project examines the role of mass media in the functioning of representative democratic government. it focuses on the frequency, accuracy, and clarity of policy cues in media content. it also explores how the public uses these cues to inform their preferences for policy in the us. the investigators begin with three important propositions. first, a responsive democratic public requires only basic levels of knowledge about policy and policy change. second,the necessary information is (in some domains) readily available in media content. third, citizens pick up on these cues and adjust their policy preferences accordingly. this project tests these propositions, leveraging differences in media coverage across policy areas drawing upon multiple news outlets in different regions of the country to understand variation in the opinion-policy link. the investigators hypothesize that there are areas where media coverage provides a reasonably accurate view of policy, and others in which media content is lacking. the accuracy of public perceptions of, and preferences for, policy should benefit or suffer accordingly. this project provides a unique, ""big"" data-driven investigation into how (and when, and why) representative democracy works. technical abstract the centerpiece of this project is an automated content-analytic dataset comprised millions of news stories and television news transcripts on us public policy, across a range of spending areas, over the past 35 years. news content is drawn from full-text databases (primarily lexis-nexis) and analyzed using both dictionary and machine-learning approaches. the reliability and validity of the method is tested through human coding. these content-analytic data are examined alongside existing budgetary time series and opinion polling. analyses offer the first large-scale exploration into the kinds of policy information that do, and do not, appear in media coverage. this will allow the team to assess how the policy preferences of individuals might change depending on the policy-relevant media content they consume. as part of the assessment of this influence, the team will provide a direct comparison of media coverage of policy and actual policy across eight policy areas. results provide a new and unique view into the role that media play in representative democracy, particularly in public responsiveness to policy, across issue areas and over time."
Collaborative Research: Role of Intellectual Capital in predicting outcomes of Entrepreneurial and Mature Firms,"entrepreneurial firms play an important role in employment generation, economic recovery, and bringing innovation to the marketplace. however, the discussion on the role played by the intellectual capital of the workforce employed by entrepreneurial firms has been limited. is it the case that the entrepreneurs that succeed are different in their stock of intellectual capital and these differences are manifested and rewarded by the market very early on, or is it that their early advantages and location choices enable them to navigate market imperfections and shocks that hinder less lucky establishments? in this project, we study how the skill-level of entrepreneurial firms in the united states has changed over the past decade particularly in response to competitive shocks. the proposed project can inform what types of entrepreneurs succeed, the specific role played by founders' human capital, and how shocks such as increased competition and technological changes affect entrepreneurial firm outcomes. to understand the drivers of the stock of intellectual capital in entrepreneurial firms, we will assemble a longitudinal database on the skill profiles of entrepreneurial firms. the data will be sourced from establishment level micro-data from a panel of large-scale surveys conducted by the bureau of labor statistics of the skills of employees of start-ups and incumbent firms in over 800 occupations in u.s. over 2005-2013. using over 10 million establishment-occupation level observations, we will address three primary research questions. first, we will identify the change in the composition of skills of entrants over this period, and factors that are associated with these changes. second, we will identify environmental shocks and their effects on the intellectual capital and competitiveness of entrepreneurial firms. finally, we will examine the long-term consequences of founding intellectual capital on firms' subsequent intellectual capital and other outcomes."
Collaborative Research:  Estimating the Technology of Skill Formation and Maternal Well-Being,"this research project will study the effects of parental skills and investment on children's cognitive and non-cognitive skills development thus impacting the long term social and economic development of these children in later life. previous studies of these effects rely on mothers' assessments of child non-cognitive skills---an assessment that may be biased---and do not account for maternal well-being on the dynamics of the child's cognitive and non-cognitive skill development. these omissions may affect the results of the effects of parental skills and investments on child development. the proposed research will use the millennium cohort study (mcs) to study the effects of parental skills and investment on children's cognitive and non-cognitive skills. in addition to assessment of non-cognitive skills by parents, the data set also contain assessment of non-cognitive skills by teachers and interviewers as well as the physical, mental, and emotional health of the mother. this will allow the researchers to study the reciprocal link from child to parent may generate important feedback effects on the child's development; therefore, limiting the biases that may arise from the omissions discussed above. the results of this research project will provide guidance to practitioners, educators and policymakers as they develop policies to improve to improve cognitive and non-cognitive skills of children. helping to understand how to improve cognitive and non-cognitive skills among children will result in a stronger work force, thus improving the long-run performance of the u.s. economy. previous studies of the effects of parental skills and investment on children's cognitive and non-cognitive skills development suffer from two potential sources of bias: they rely on the mother's, possibly biased, assessment of the child's non-cognitive skills and do not allow for possible feedback effect the child's cognitive and non-cognitive development may have on the mother's skills. to address these issues, the pis will use two features of the millennium cohort study (mcs). first, the mcs dataset collects measures of child non-cognitive skills from mothers, and from interviewers and teachers. second, the mcs interviews mothers on their mental health and life satisfaction during each wave of the survey. using this data, the pis will estimate a technology of skill formation characterized by dynamic, nonlinear production functions where both inputs and outputs are unobserved. key inputs include contemporaneous child skills, parental skills, and parental investment, while the next period's cognitive and non-cognitive skills for both the child and the mother are the relevant outputs. to achieve identification, the researchers rely on the availability of noisy measures of child skills, parental skills and parental investment each period, following the methodology of cunha, heckman and schennach (2010). the identification of the contamination of mother-assessed child non-cognitive skills relies on allowing the observed measures of non-cognitive skills, as reported by teachers and interviewers, to be a function of both maternal skills and child skills. the results of this research project will contribute to a better understanding of the link between parental skills and investment and child outcomes and will provide guidance to practitioners, educators and policymakers as they develop policies to improve cognitive and non-cognitive skill development of children."

"Collaborative Research:  What Do Leaders Want?: Collecting and Coding Issue Positions and Demands in the Militarized Interstate Dispute (MID) Data, 1816-2010","general abstract this research investigates a strange paradox that persists in the study of international conflict. most theories explain international conflict in terms of differences over issues or across issue positions, but few actually examine the particular types of issues lead states to fight. this is due primarily to the lack of good data on the types of issues over which states contend. this work will alleviate this problem by collecting data on all salient issues for all actors involved in militarized conflicts from 1816 to 2010. for each issue in contention the team will code the status of the issue at the beginning of the dispute for each actor, each actor's initial position on the issue, and how those positions change as the conflict persists. the data will provide policymakers and scholars the ability to generalize about the causes and consequences of international conflict with a greater level of precision, examining the specific issues most likely to lead to conflict and how issue positions evolve as states demonstrate their capabilities and willingness to fight. technical abstract international conflict scholars know territorial issues are war-prone while bargaining models provide a theoretical roadmap to the onset and evolution of militarized conflict. however, territorial conflict scholarship routinely conflates indicators over what leads states fight with indicators of why states are fighting. meanwhile, bargaining theory's rich formal models cannot actually be tested because the appropriate data on issue positions does not exist. the current militarized interstate disputes (mid) dataset gives us only broad summary measures, and no other data set is available to document issue positions of combatants over time and across the international system. this project addresses this by building on the team's previous projects that gathered and analyzed source data on militarized interstate disputes. the team will collect, code, and analyze issue positions and issue position change data within all disputes from 1816 to 2010. the corresponding data set generate will provide information about initial demands from disputants and will chronicle the evolution of these demands over the duration of the dispute. these data are central for bargaining model assumptions that states respond to demonstrations of capabilities and resolve, and specific issues are important for those arguing threats to territory are difficult to settle. this extensive coding project will also provide firsthand experience for numerous graduate and undergraduate student researchers."
RIDIR: Collaborative Research: cyberSW: A Data Synthesis and Knowledge Discovery System for Long-term Interdisciplinary Research on Southwest Social Change,"abstract this project will create cybersw, an integrated knowledge discovery system that will significantly enhance interdisciplinary research on long-term social change at decadal to centennial scales. the project will result in the data integration of millions of objects from tens of thousands of prehispanic settlements across the u.s. southwest, making it one of the largest digital archaeological repositories in the world. a major challenge in using archaeological data is that most relevant information is not digitally curated or synthesized beyond individual projects. a number of recent synthesis projects in the u.s. southwest show the great potential of these data for addressing big questions in the social sciences such as: what promotes the success or failure of some societies? how does migration transform social identities and create new social structures? and, what are the relationships between environmental challenges and social changes? we will build on these prior projects to produce an integrated system that will allow users at different levels of expertise to readily view, analyze, and export data on past societies in the southwest to address these and many other questions relevant to contemporary society. due to preservation and intensity of investigations, the u.s. southwest has an unparalleled high quality archaeological record of human occupation and social change. archaeological data are geospatially- and temporally-referenced and include variables such as population scale and movement, social diversity and inequality, technological innovations and diffusion, and climate. through the creation of cybersw the proposed project will realize the cumulative research potential of these data by (1) merging several existing synthetic databases into one scalable, networked digital repository; (2) collecting additional data to fill in spatial, temporal, and material culture gaps; (3) analyzing those data and creating user-friendly online tools for data analysis and visualization; and (4) establishing a web portal for data visualization, analysis, and sharing that is available to both professional researchers and the general public. making these data usable to researchers and to the public ensures that the findings of archaeological research are accessible, interpretable, and replicable. the online analytical tools will allow a wide range of individuals to conduct their own analyses, whether tribal members interested in their history, land managers responsible for public interpretation, students learning data manipulation and display, or social scientists grappling with the long-term questions about the human past. a citizen science component for registered volunteers will allow a bigger community to participate in transformative science."
EAGER:  Collaborative Research:  A Benchmark Data Linkage Repository (DLRep),"this eager award provides pilot funding for a new kind of software repository that could help data scientists create better ways to combine existing data sets. the goal is to encourage collaboration between scientists who consider data methodology, users and builders of integrated data sets, and data custodians. the result may be new high-quality methods for record linkages and better use of existing data. common, transparent, and reproducible approaches to linkage methodology and privacy preservation will help data analysts meet the highest scientific standards. the project may decrease the gap between research and practice in data science, resulting in better evidence for u.s. policymakers, businesses, and citizens. the pis will establish a common benchmarking repository of linkage methodologies, data link repository (dlrep) at the inter-university consortium for political and social research (icpsr) at the university of michigan. participants in the repository will be able to add comments and ask questions, allowing for engagement between data custodians, providers, producers, holders and data users, as well as between various groups of data users. in addition data users will be able to upload and share code snippets related to the data, allowing for knowledge sharing and better reproducibility. data users will be able to link related publications and citations via doi import or by manually entering citation information. this will provide feedback to data providers and other data users about how the data have been used. the repository will accelerate the development of new record linkage algorithms and evaluation methods by providing access to both methods and relevant data. this community effort will improved the reproducibility of analysis conducted on integrated data. the repository will facilitate comparisons of alternative linkage methodologies when using the same and different data, and move forward the provision of privacy-aware integrated data."
"Collaborative Research: RUI: Corporate Law, Finance, and Productivity in Historical Perspective","this research studies the legal and institutional foundations of industrial and financial development. the particulars of commercial, contract, enterprise, and corporate law can have major consequences for how firms are organized and financed, with repercussions for the pace and structure of economic development in a society. the investigators examine the case of the russian empire around the turn of the twentieth century, because it offers a combination of uniquely high quality data and a particular set of legal and financial characteristics, all of which make it possible to study the relationships among company law, finance, and firm performance in an industrializing economy. this project collects and analyzes the new dataset while training a large number of undergraduate research assistants in statistical and research methods. this project involves the collection and analysis of firm-level data describing russian corporations before the october revolution of 1917. the data collection is international in scope, drawing on original corporate charters, archival records of firms and financial markets, and a wealth of historical newspapers, government reports, and other materials culled from archives and libraries in the united states, russia, and europe. the new dataset links the legal rules governing individual corporations to their subsequent financial characteristics, productivity, and market valuations. the publicly-available databases generated as part of the project are of interest to scholars in diverse fields such as corporate law, finance, economic history, economic geography, industrial organization, and russian history. the imperial russian setting not only offers data of uniquely high quality for a developing economy, but it also provides substantial variation in the legal structures of corporations and in the underlying financial and industrial conditions. this enables the econometric evaluation of causal hypotheses regarding how corporations were financed and how imperial russian legal and economic institutions functioned. thus, this historical project speaks to the role that legal institutions, corporate governance, and finance play in the process of economic development. the project's findings are salient for understanding the historical context of current legal and economic conditions in the russian federation, an area of current u.s. policy concern. this research involves undergraduate research assistants at every stage. these students learn methods of data coding, acquire skills in estimating econometric models, become conversant with a broad and interdisciplinary scholarship, and gain experience working with russian-language sources. mentoring undergraduates aligns with goals of both principal investigators' primarily undergraduate institutions."
"Collaborative Research:  DCL:  HBCU EAGER Network effects, competition and survival of small and minority owned firms in public procurement","award abstract alexander/kosmopoulous collaborative research: hbcu dcl, earger: network effects, competition and survival of small minority-owned firms in public procurement small firms, especially those owned by economically disadvantaged groups, provide a large share of employment for this population. these companies are often at competitive disadvantage when they compete against large firms and often lose in the process. can these firms form networks to learn from each other, increase their efficiency, compete effectively against larger firms and expand their activities? how do these networks affect the chance of winning a bid and effectively carrying out the project? this research project will use data from the state of oklahoma road construction bidding program to study the impact of networks on efficiency of small minority-owned businesses. the study will focus on factors that increase the chances of forming networks and the effects of these networks on firm success in bidding, cost efficiency, profits, and long-term stability. the results of this research project will increase our understanding what determines the success of small minority-owned firms and in the process, provide policy guidance on how best to increase the competitiveness of small firms generally. because the results of this research project could guide policies to increase the efficiency of small firms, the results could also increase the competitiveness of the u.s. economy. this collaborative research will study the industrial organization and competitiveness of small minority-owned firms. specifically, it will use administrative and field data to study the effects of network formation on the success and survival of small, minority-owned firms in bidding for and completion of government infrastructural contracts. the research focuses on: (i) strategic network formation among contractors who repeatedly compete or cooperate in contracting jobs; (ii) the impacts of networks on the probability of a small minority-owned firm winning a bid for contract; (iii) the effects of networks on the survival of small firms. the state of oklahoma construction bidding data has enough detailed information to allow the pis to identify networks, control for heterogeneity of firms and ownership structure when analyzing the effects of networks on efficiency. the pis will develop an auctions model that allows for information asymmetries across different types of firms due to differences in experience, efficiency and network connections. the model treats network formation as endogenously determined by firm net profitability in a network relative to profitability outside a network. the pis will use bayesian methods to estimate the models. the results of this research project will inform our understanding of the relationship between network formation and efficiency of small minority-owned firms and in the process, contribute to the competitiveness of the u.s. economy."
"Collaborative Research: Forgiveness, Revenge, and Social Status in Groups","collaborative research: forgiveness, revenge, and social status in groups this project investigates the social factors that encourage individuals to pursue either forgiveness or revenge. vengeful behavior harms relationships and careers, and invites retaliation or legal sanctions. forgiveness avoids these risks, but can instead make the forgiver vulnerable to exploitation. understanding why people pursue forgiveness or revenge is an important scientific puzzle and a pressing practical concern. to answer this question, the project investigates the conditions under which forgiveness or revenge will be valued and rewarded in groups. the project contributes to understanding society by developing an explanation for how forgiving and vengeful behaviors shape individuals' social standing in groups, and testing this explanation with rigorous methods. the research combines a nationally representative survey on americans' attitudes towards forgiveness and revenge with laboratory experiments that examines how people behave when they observe forgiving or vengeful behavior, as well as why people engage in these behaviors themselves. given the ubiquity of conflict, the costs of revenge, and the challenges of forgiveness, the research may have a number of broader impacts. broadly, the project speaks to conflicts around issues such as contentious politics, fan violence, and national identity. by explaining why some groups will value revenge or forgiveness, the research could help us understand why some conflicts are resolved quickly (when disputants choose forgiveness) while others spiral out of control (when disputants choose revenge). by achieving these goals, the research can help point us towards more effective conflict resolution strategies. the research also contributes to the training of graduate and undergraduate students. past work in understanding revenge and forgiveness focuses on micro- or macro-level factors, leading sociologists to call for greater attention to meso-level factors, such as intra and intergroup processes. responding to this call, the project develops and tests hypotheses centered on the idea that, under certain conditions, acts of forgiveness or revenge produce group benefits, and as a result are viewed as worthy of social status -- respect, prestige, and esteem -- from group members. the project also investigates whether groups tend to view forgiveness versus revenge as relatively more status-worthy, and how groups influence individuals to engage in forgiving or vengeful behaviors. to answer these questions, the project employs a survey experiment and two behavioral lab experiments. the survey experiment (study 1) uses a nationally representative sample of us adults to examine the conditions under which americans view revenge or forgiveness as worthy of social status. it does so for three different social contexts: politics, sports, and national identity. the lab experiments will complement the survey experiment by using a behavioral measure of social status (study 2) and evaluating whether individuals engage in more vengeful or forgiving behavior when their groups have a history of rewarding these behaviors with social status (study 3). by combining nationally-representative survey data (including three conceptual replications with different social identities) with behavioral lab experiments, the design strengthens both the external and internal validity of our findings."

Collaborative Research: Inequalities in Technology Use and Health Lifestyles of Children and Adults,"this project will analyze the use of technologies by children and teenagers in the mobile internet era. the focus is how technology use is situated within the interaction of children's lives and families, and how social class plays into these processes. with technologies changing rapidly, research on young people's technology use have lagged. the study will contribute to knowledge in several areas. first, the project will provide new information about the type, frequency, and context of technology use among children and youth. second, investigators will build upon the emerging body of evidence and theory on children's health lifestyles by integrating technology use as a health behavior. third, investigators will consider children's and parents' negotiations, practices, and emerging understandings around technology use. understanding children's technology use as it relates to other behavior is important for improving the longer-term development, health, and well-being of children. this is particularly important for marginalized populations--racial/ethnic minorities, children of immigrants, and children living in poverty. student training is central to the project, with students heavily involved in analysis, dissemination of findings, theoretical development, and integration of quantitative and qualitative results. relatively little is known about children's technology use in the mobile technology era or about how current patterns of technology use relate to other aspects of health lifestyles, such as physical activity or socializing with peers, in early life. this project will address three research questions. first, how does social class currently shape children's technology use and its role in their health lifestyles? second, how does social class influence parents' perceptions of emerging technologies and their strategies for structuring and negotiating children's access to and use of these technologies? third, do family negotiations and practices around technology use help to explain socioeconomic variation in children's technology use? this project will draw on two new data sources to provide breadth and depth in understanding the relationship between social class and contemporary children's technology use and processes underlying it. the 2014 child development supplement (cds) of the panel study of income dynamics collected survey and time diary data from a us-representative sample ages 0-17. the 2016 children's health lifestyles study provides multimethod qualitative data on families with elementary-aged children. the observational data permit a fuller understanding of the social settings of technology use, and interview and focus groups illuminate perceptions of and negotiations around it."

CCE STEM: Collaborative Research:  Efficacy of Macroethics Education in Engineering,"non-technical: this award by the cultivating cultures of ethical stem program in the directorate for social, behavioral & economic sciences is managed by the biomaterials program in the division of materials research. the goal of this collaborative project at university of colorado at boulder, tufts university and seattle university is to evaluate the various ways in which macroethics is taught in stem topics (both in and out of the classroom), and determine the most effective methods that can then be adopted by others. in order for stem areas to reach its full potential to benefit society, students must be prepared to engage in broad considerations of the ethical issues that face the profession. established codes of conduct describe standards for professional behavior, but these largely relate to individual actions associated with individual projects, so-called 'micro'-ethical considerations. but engineering and other stem areas fall short of its societal duties, if it ignores 'macro'-ethical challenges - ethical issues that must consider societal implications of technology as well as the collective responsibility of the stem profession. macroethics includes issues such as sustainability, poverty and underdevelopment, security and peace, social justice, bioethics, nanoscience, and social responsibility. the extent to which stem students graduate with an understanding of macroethical issues is unclear, and is in need of organization. the research will start with a large survey of stem faculty across the u.s., followed by interviews of selected faculty who are effectively using a diversity of methods to teach a range of macroethical issues. in addition, a set of case studies that can serve as models for others will be developed. best practices that are identified will be propagated through stem education via a faculty training workshop and online resources. technical: there is a need for stem education to prepare students to address macroethical issues such as social responsibility and sustainability. the extent to which students graduate with an understanding of macroethical issues is unclear and in need of organization. the goal of this research is to evaluate the various ways in which macroethics is taught in stem topics, examining variations in pedagogy and content between different stem disciplines and institution types. macroethics educational practices will be examined through vanasupa's four-domain development model, which includes both cognitive and affective outcomes, as well as the impact of social context. the methods that are most appealing and successful for educating women and minority students in stem will be determined. the research goals will be achieved through: (1) a national survey and targeted interviews of ethics instructors; (2) a case study approach to identify effective macroethical instruction settings based on student surveys and interviews, rubric assessment of student work, ethnographic observations, and surveys/interviews with alumni regarding the impacts of ethics education in their practice of stem topics; and (3) propagate and scale the best practices of macroethics education using approaches similar to that of nsf's i-corps-l model. instructors at seattle university and the university of colorado will adapt effective methods in their teaching. dissemination will include a faculty workshop, project website, and publications."
Collaborative Research: Career Success in Government Bureaucracy: Evidence from Individual-Level Data,"abstract: 1729806.fisman title change: career success in government bureaucracy: evidence from individual-level data leaders affect performance in many kinds of organizations: business, government, and non-profit. this award funds four different projects that will use novel data sources to shed new light on the kinds of college graduates who enter bureaucratic careers, the choices they make about how to allocate their time to various tasks, and how political connections may help them advance. the results are important for economic science for two reasons. first, it is known that government performance is key to overall economic performance for developing countries, which is one reason why political corruption can be a barrier to economic growth. understanding the circumstances that lead to high-functioning governments is a first step to determining how policies, such as anti-corruption programs or rules governing bureaucratic promotion, may spur economic growth. second, testing theories about how local government officials allocate their time across competing priorities is a test of more general economic theories of government. the research team will use new data from china to test these hypotheses; thus, the project can help u.s. businesses to navigate the complexities of working in china and will help us understand the role of government in china?s rapid economic growth. the pis plan to explore who chooses to become a bureaucrat, what factors affect career success, and what groups of officials (city mayors and party secretaries) do once they have attained higher office. the research will analyze how each of these questions is affected by anti-corruption policies. the pis will collect several novel datasets for analysis, using information provided by universities, information published in national and local city newspapers, data from civil service exam results and from university libraries, and biographical information available on the web. the pis will employ novel identification strategies and the research contributes new data and methods to the literature on bureaucratic governance in an international context. in addition to contributing to the academic literature, the results of this research also will provide inputs into how best to reduce corruption, improve governance, hence accelerate economic growth in developing countries."
Collaborative Research:   Attention in Games and Decisions,"attention is a limited resource whose absence may adversely affect decision-making by increasing cognitive load. it has even been suggested that people trapped in poverty may suffer disproportionately from this problem. in this proposal the principal investigators undertake research to increase our understanding of the process of decision making in strategic situations under attentional constraints by directly quantifying what people focus on when they make their attention-allocation decisions. such issues not only affect individuals, but also complex organizations run by ceo's and elected officials if they do not allocate their own or their employee's time efficiently across the problems they face. thus, a detailed understanding of what attracts a decision maker's attention to a problem is of significant potential importance. if successful, the work conducted here may move us in the direction of a better understanding of the behavior of people who must make choices under self-imposed attentional constraints. on a technical level, the work proposed combines laboratory experiments with eye tracking techniques. in the experiments, subjects do not engage in strategic interactions or make decisions directly, but rather project how much time they want to allocate in the future across a set of problems presented to them. features of these problems that attract subjects' attention will be identified using eye tracking and measures of attention time. a second goal of the project is to relate the process of attention allocation to decision making by correlating the amount of time a subject intends to allocate to contemplating a problem in the future to the decision time that subjects actually take when facing this same problem. finally, eye tracking will be used to discover whether subjects attend to different aspects of the decision problems they face when allocating their attention as opposed to actually making a decision."
Collaborative Research: Accounting for the Rise in College Tuition,"abstract: collaborative research: accounting for the rise in college tuition persistent rising college tuition and student debt in the u.s. are growing public policy concerns, yet factors driving their growth remain unresolved. with its combination of extensive public subsidies, complicated financial aid rules, segmented market structure, and widespread use of differential tuition pricing, the higher education market functions quite differently from many other markets. in addition, most traditional colleges are non-profit institutions that pursue objectives that differ from those of profit-maximizing firms. in addition, the incentives colleges face are less well understood. this research project develops a new approach to quantify the determinants of u.s. college tuition and how they contribute to tuition inflation, as well as assess the impact of programs aimed at expanding college access and easing the burden of student debt. focusing on explaining the aggregate trends in college tuition increases, it will shed light on differences across college types and investigates ways to promote educational opportunity across the socioeconomic spectrum. the methods used in this research can also serve as a template for future students and researchers interested in studying the complex higher education market. the results of this research can help policy makers develop better policies to increase higher education attainment for the american workforce, hence improving u.s. competitiveness. the proposed research develops an equilibrium structural model that includes life-cycle decision-making by households, imperfect competition and price discrimination in the higher education sector, student loan borrowing, and uninsurable post-graduation earnings risk. relative to the existing literature, the presence of forward-looking behavior and higher expected post-graduation earnings endogenously motivates college attendance and facilitates taking the model to the data. the model is then used to test and quantify various hypotheses for the rise in college tuition---an approach which permits counterfactual analysis and decomposition of tuition drivers. lastly, the project will use the model to study the efficacy of recent and proposed reforms whose goals are to restrain the growth of tuition and student debt. the results of this research project will help guide policies aimed at improving college education, thereby increasing the u.s.?s human capital and competitiveness."
Collaborative Research: Bayesian Approaches for Inference on Brain Connectivity,"this collaborative research project will develop new statistical methods for the analysis and interpretation of brain imaging data. statistical methods that improve signal detection and that lead to clinically relevant insights into the patterns of brain functions are needed. this research will advance understanding of how the different regions of the brain interact and share information with each other during a task or at rest. the statistical methods to be developed will have the potential to impact both statistics and neuroimaging and will apply generally to studies where multiple types of neuroimaging data are measured on groups of subjects. from a societal perspective, the acquired knowledge will guide clinicians in the selection of optimally targeted treatments to improve the quality of life of individuals. the project will include educational and training activities for graduate students. findings will be disseminated to the research community and used to further interdisciplinary collaborative efforts in neuroimaging. software and code will be developed and deposited in public repositories. the new statistical methods to be developed will integrate the information provided by multiple imaging modalities collected on groups of subjects. a particular focus of the proposed research is to characterize the heterogeneity of brain functioning both within and between subjects. this research will produce flexible bayesian statistical methods that can share information across subjects and take into account available knowledge on brain structure and functional mechanisms. new integrative spatio-temporal models will allow for the presence of highly connected and persistent hubs in the brain networks. dynamic graphical model approaches will increase understanding of the dynamic nature of functional brain connectivity and how connectivity is disrupted when subjects are completing tasks. the investigators will apply the new methods to imaging data from subjects with a neurological disorder (epilepsy or schizophrenia) and data from healthy individuals who will serve as controls. understanding the role that abnormalities in the brain connectome play in various neurological diseases has been a major focus in connectivity studies. comparative analyses of data from healthy individuals serving as controls will allow the identification of differences in connectivity across groups of subjects and how they affect multiple cognitive domains."
Collaborative Research:  New Algorithms for Computing Equilibria of Stochastic Games,"this research focuses on models of dynamic strategic behavior, in which two parties (individuals, nations, corporations, agencies) interact repeatedly over a long horizon and make decisions that have a persistent impact on the environment. the pis are developing algorithms to simulate behavior in which each party has consistent beliefs about how others will behave and is maximizing their own welfare given those beliefs. these computational methods can be applied to a wide range of models that are used in various fields of economics, as well as in other disciplines such as international relations and evolutionary biology. more specifically, the pis study the pure strategy subgame perfect equilibria of infinitely repeated games with geometric discounting and a stochastic state variable. the state variable determines the set of actions that can be taken by the agents in each period of the game and the resultant payoffs. conditional on the actions taken by the players, the state evolves as a markov chain. the objective of the research is to develop algorithms for computing the discounted payoffs that players can obtain in subgame perfect equilibria starting in each state. the pis will also develop and distribute software packages that implement the algorithms."
RIDIR: Collaborative Research: DAPPR: Diffusion Analytics for Public Policy Research,"stability in social, technical, and financial systems, as well as the capacity of organizations to work across borders, requires consistency in public policy across jurisdictions. however, progress depends upon innovative policy solutions to society's problems. the transmission of laws and regulations across political boundaries averts a conflict between the incentives for innovation and consistency. the current project will offer a database that allows the tracking of the spread of policies through the us states. the database will be disseminated through project webpages. the web interface will also include advanced analytics that illuminate the pathways through which policies spread. users will be able to download the data and software for their own custom analysis of policy transmission in the us states. policy diffusion has been a topic of focus across the social sciences for several decades, but due to limitations of data and computational technology, researchers have not taken a comprehensive look at patterns of diffusion across many different policies. the investigators propose to combine cutting-edge methods of text and network analysis to understand how policies, as represented in digitized text, spread through networks connecting the american states. the investigators will develop both data and computational methods that address the most pressing limitations to the study of policy diffusion networks. the project will result in two key contributions: (1) a comprehensive source of data with which to track the movement of policies from one state government to another, across three governing branches, and (2) a user-friendly, open source software package for understanding and visualizing diffusion networks from digitized records of policies. these resources will help researchers, public officials, advocacy groups, and other relevant stakeholders understand how to balance the competing goals of innovation and consistency in public policy."
Collaborative Research: Smooth National Measurement of Public Opinion Across Boundaries and Levels: A View From the Bayesian Spatial Approach,"this research project will measure public opinion in voting constituencies around the united states. the project will provide estimates of opinion in districts with little or no survey data, such as state legislative districts. the project's intellectual merit comes from establishing a new means for measuring public opinion that not only uses survey respondents' answers to polling questions but also incorporates important information about where respondents are located and what that implies about geographic patterns in public opinion. coupled with population information from the u.s. census, the project will produce stronger estimates of public sentiment when survey data are sparsely distributed. the investigators will release free software that includes user-friendly functions allowing any citizen to determine public opinion in his or her own district or in districts that have not yet cast any votes, such as proposed congressional districts in a redistricting cycle. the software will allow more sophisticated users to obtain measures for any variable (even if unrelated to public opinion) in relationship to geographic boundaries, which will have extensions to research in public health, epidemiology, economics, sociology, business, and law. the broader impact to society will be that the data and software from this project will provide more information for the news media, the public, and elected officials regarding the outlook of the nation by constituency and locale, thereby providing a better understanding of the american representation process. the project will recruit a diverse group of research assistants that will be trained in this kind of statistical analysis. studies relating to public opinion often settle for less-than-ideal data. frequently, researchers will measure public opinion in the 50 states or the 435 congressional districts by pooling together several surveys taken over time (losing a sense of change over time), using old measures of public opinion (which may not be consistent with current public views), or using presidential vote share to approximate public sentiment (which is prone to error because factors besides ideology affect vote choices). with smaller districts than these, such as state legislative districts, the problem is magnified considerably, because it is rare to have many survey respondents in such a small area. in this project, the investigators ask: how can survey responses and the geographic location of the respondents be used to reliably forecast constituency public opinion? to answer this question, the investigators will use the method of bayesian universal kriging. this technique fits a training model over survey data to determine how demographic factors shape public opinion and how the portion of survey responses that cannot be explained by demographics can be explained by a geographically smoothed process. with a model like this, public opinion in constituencies can be predicted with known population demographics and the values of the geographically smoothed error process over that district."
Collaborative Research: Impacts of social context and ecology on strategic decisions in dynamic interactions,"understanding how individuals manage or fail to coordinate their behavior in social settings where coordination is beneficial is a fundamental objective of social science. to the extent such understanding informs our ability to promote or impede coordination it is also of great practical importance for improving the performance of teams or disrupting the performance of adversaries. recent research has investigated the underpinnings of strategic interactions in social settings between humans using simple economic games drawn from game theory as models for human decision-making. even more recently, these methods have been used to look at strategic behavior more broadly across primate species, allowing for inter-species comparisons. much of this work, however, in both humans and other primates, has involved only pairs of individuals, whereas in the real world such decisions take place within the rapidly changing dynamics of larger social groups. the current research project will study the decisions made by two species of non-human primates, capuchin monkeys and chimpanzees, while they are interacting in their social groups. the research will focus on how these species solve coordination problems depending on the social context and ecological conditions in which the interactions occur. the research will also examine how human subjects behave in virtual environments matched to those in which the non-human primates have been studied. the research has two primary objectives. the first is to examine who participates and doesn't in situations where individuals can coordinate (or not) to acquire a reward, how participation varies with payoffs, and how it varies with changes in social context. two species - chimpanzees and capuchins - are selected for this part of the study because there is evidence that both cooperate, exhibit variation in success in cooperating, and are available for study in sufficiently large social groups. the second aim is to use humans to examine the influence of ecological conditions and variation in such conditions on the manifestation of strategic behavior. subjects will make decisions in a virtual environment with specific ecological conditions and in which benefits of cooperation or anti-cooperation can be varied. the characteristics of the virtual environment will match features of environments in which behavior of capuchins and chimpanzees has already been observed to enable interspecies comparison. this part of the study will shine light on the question of how important language is to humans' remarkable ability to come to pareto optimal solutions in social interactions"

Collaborative Research: Judicial Diversity and Appellate Decision Making,"by the end of 2016, over one-third of the federal appeals court bench was made up of women and over one-fifth were racial minorities. these figures stand in stark contrast to forty years earlier when the same appellate courts counted just one woman and three minority judges on active service. this study uses social science theories and methods to examine how this historic demographic transformation of the federal bench affects deliberations, opinion writing, and organizational practices on the u.s. circuit courts of appeals. these findings will offer new and important insights on the intermediate appellate courts that serve a vital role in the administration of justice in the federal court system. data are collected from published judicial opinions of the u.s. courts of appeals, biographical materials, and publicly available transcribed oral arguments, to test competing perspectives from social science theories about the effects of diversity on judicial decision making. one set of theories focuses on the way in which differing perspectives of individuals linked to race and gender affect small group decision making. another set of theories predicts that interactions during oral argument and subsequent citations to opinions will reflect on societal processes that generalize stereotypes about gender, race, status, and power. finally, theories on gender and racial identity predict that women and minority judges will bring new approaches to oral argument, collaboration, and opinion drafting. to test these various expectations, this study leverages recent advances in linguistic software and automated methods of content analysis to produce a novel dataset of opinion content and extend an existing public resource, the multi-user database of u.s. courts of appeals decisions."
Collaborative Research: Robust and Reliable Research Workshop Proposal: Rethinking Comparison in the Social Sciences,"general abstract comparison is an important research tool in the social sciences. scholars make comparisons across time and place to better understand a wide range of political and social phenomena. one of the central techniques that social scientists often use is the controlled comparison, whereby scholars hold potential explanatory factors constant across different cases to help them assess their contribution to particular outcomes. this approach has been central to some of the most influential works of social science. it has helped scholars explain everything from why some countries are rich and some are poor to why some countries are democratic and some are authoritarian. yet even as controlled comparisons have produced lasting insights, they are not the only form of comparison that scholars utilize to answer important questions about social and political life. there is little guidance, however, on how to develop and execute comparisons that do not rely on the controlled case model, and what types of insights alternative comparison models can offer. the goal of this project is to lay out just such guidelines. to do so, this project will explore two of the most fundamental questions in the study of politics: (1) how and why scholars decide on what they compare, and (2) how the methodological assumptions scholars make about why and how they compare shape the knowledge they produce. by answering these questions, the project will create new resources for future students and researchers to draw upon in their efforts to advance knowledge. technical abstract this project aims to reimagine three central components of the comparative method in order to develop new logics for comparative research designs that move beyond traditional controlled comparison designs. first, it will encourage political scientists to think critically about what a case is by challenging dominant norms and encouraging scholars to think of processes, practices, meanings, and concepts as cases to be compared. second, the project will expand the notion of what it means to compare. it aims to push scholars to conceptualize comparison as a method that includes approaches beyond controlled comparison, including greater attention to the experiences of subjects being studied and the ways those experiences re-order social worlds. finally, the project proposes to expand the explanatory goals of comparative research by de-emphasizing variations in outcomes and opening up variations in political processes, meanings, and concepts as similarities or differences to be explained. to achieve these goals, this project will convene a workshop on comparative methods, and produce an edited volume based on contributions emerging from the workshop that will serve as a resource for scholars looking to conduct non-controlled comparisons to guide future scholars in new research directions."
Collaborative Research: Escaping the boom-bust cycle: Identifying sustainable governance strategies for shale-dependent communities,"the project studies how communities affected by boom-bust cycles in natural resource extraction - specifically shale oil and gas drilling - try to reduce the cycle's local negative consequences and extend its positive impacts. in a boom-bust cycle, communities rich in natural resources experience rapid economic growth when demand spikes, then rapid economic decline when resources are exhausted or demand dissipates. both trends are often accompanied by increases in crime, infrastructure damage, and environmental degradation, and reduced quality of life. there is little research on how communities use the tools of county and city-level governance - such as public investment, subsidies, taxes, and zoning - to manage societal problems linked to boom-bust cycles and perpetuate positive impacts, such as increases in local employment, after a boom ends. the project identifies governance strategies used by localities in three u.s. states (ohio, pennsylvania, west virginia) affected by the recent shale drilling boom and bust. it examines how community characteristics and local and regional networks of information and resource-sharing among policymaking participants may influence the strategies communities adopt. finally, it studies how citizens and stakeholders perceive these strategies and which factors encourage communities to deploy more successful governance approaches. this project is a mixed-methods investigation of the strategies that local governments pursue to mitigate adverse impacts and leverage positive aspects of the shale drilling boom-bust cycle. by conducting interviews and analyzing survey data with social network and statistical techniques, the research team examines how ohio, pennsylvania, and west virginia communities overlaying the marcellus and utica shales have tried to manage the boom-bust cycle. specifically, the researchers investigate: how pressures from citizens, stakeholders, and government actors affect whether cities and counties adopt boom-bust governance strategies, which strategies they choose, and how strategies diffuse among jurisdictions; whether systematic differences exist between jurisdictions that fail to consider a given approach, fail to adopt it, or adopt it successfully; and how the composition of and strength of ties within local governance networks influence the strategies jurisdictions adopt and how successful citizens, stakeholders, and decision makers view the strategies. the project brings a cross-sectional, quantitative approach to issues typically studied with qualitative, small-n techniques, building theoretical micro-foundations for and testing key assumptions in the policy diffusion and adoption, sustainability, and boom-bust literatures. the research aims to produce actionable insights for communities currently experiencing pernicious boom-bust effects."
Collaborative Research: Measuring Apparent Race and Ethnicity with Applications to the Study of Discrimination,"this research project will advance the quantitative measurement of apparent race and ethnicity. racial and ethnic categories often are thought of as natural, discrete, and mutually exclusive. a person is either, say, an african-american, an asian-american, a european-american, or an hispanic-american. but many people are of mixed ancestry or mixed identity. there is growing evidence that the societal discrimination and inequalities conventionally associated with racial and ethnic categories vary within those categories. this body of research has been limited, however, by serious measurement problems. the most widely used measure of skin color is not reliable, and there is no generally accepted method for quantifying racial or ethnic appearance beyond skin color. this project adapts statistical measurement models that have been used in many other domains to produce new, quantitative measures of racial and ethnic appearance. the investigators will develop open-source software for generating the measures. from a societal perspective, these results will have important implications for government agencies and courts of law. phenotype discrimination, for example, is understood to be a civil rights violation. judges, however, have struggled with and generally rejected such claims in practice, due to doubts about whether phenotype is something that can be measured objectively. this research project will test hypotheses about the robustness of new, quantitative measures of racial and ethnic appearance to variation in the dress and facial expressions of the persons being observed and to variation in the identity and mood of the persons doing the observing. the project is designed to answer questions that have long confounded academic researchers, government agencies, and courts of law: is there a societal consensus about racial and ethnic appearance? to what extent does racial/ethnic appearance depend on physical attributes of the person being observed or on other factors, such as dress or socioeconomic status of the person being observed? the investigators will examine whether different ways of eliciting race/ethnicity perceptions (e.g., perceived skin color, perceived stereotypicality, and perceived ancestry) yield measures that are congruent across different populations of observers and robust to variation in the apparent status and attitudes of the person being observed and the mood of the observer."
Collaborative Research: Further Strengthening Qualitative Research Through Methodological Innovation and Integration: Media Coverage of Social Movements,"to understand social movements and the politics of the disadvantaged one needs to understand the media coverage of social movement and political advocacy organizations. these organizations provide critical resources to seek social change, help construct political identities, and spur civic engagement. the attention of the mass news media is critical to these organizations. news coverage shows that these organizations are being treated as legitimate spokespersons and helps them influence public opinion and policy agendas. this project augments a previous collection of approximately one million articles published in the twentieth century in four national newspapers--the new york times, washington post, wall street journal, and los angeles times. this project will capture data in all 18 newspapers available through proquest historical newspapers, including a wealth of regional and african-american newspapers, and will extend these data through the first 15 years of this century. the project will also gather more extensive information about the articles, coverage data on major interest groups, and organizational data on the advocacy and movement organizations in the sample. these data will be supplemented with television news and social media data. in addition to creating this valuable data set, the key merits of the project include the addressing of several research questions regarding the causes of the amount and quality of coverage of movements and their organizations. the project will also result in the training of graduate students and produce several scholarly articles that identify and explain movement coverage and its consequences, and a scholarly monograph. the project addresses several key empirical and ""why"" questions about these organizations? news coverage: which organizations and allied movements have received the greatest newspaper and tv coverage? which organizations have received the greatest attention in their movements? how has the coverage changed over time and across movements? are coverage patterns similar across national, regional, and african-american newspapers? do movements usually gain substantive coverage in articles in which they are mentioned? what accounts for extensive newspaper coverage of a movement and its activities? what accounts for extensive newspaper coverage for individual organizations within a movement? are the patterns of coverage consistent with the main theories of social movements?resource mobilization, new social movement, grievance, and political process and political reform theories? how has the connection between newspaper coverage and movement activity changed with the decline of newspapers and the rise of the internet and social media? under which conditions do movement actors receive substantive news coverage? the project will address these questions by synthesizing negative binomial regression analyses on counts data and qualitative methods, notably fuzzy set qualitative comparative analyses and comparative historical analyses. the analyses combine big-data gathering with qualitative coding of newspapers. unlike most large-n work, the project can return to the original data, the newspaper articles, to refine hypotheses and build theory."
Collaborative Research: The Impact of Face-to-Face and Remote Interviewing,"despite widespread dissemination of best-practice standards for conducting forensic interviews, many jurisdictions lack the expertise to skillfully investigate crimes involving child witnesses. an efficient way to ensure that all jurisdictions have access to highly trained child interviewers is to conduct remote (live-streaming video) forensic interviews. remote interviewing could reduce investigative response time, spare investigative resources, and accelerate case disposition. however, the ability of remote interviewing to elicit eyewitness evidence from children has not been sufficiently tested and, therefore, will certainly prompt challenges regarding children?s testimonial reliability. the current project is a comprehensive and theoretically grounded evaluation of the effectiveness of remote interviewing of child witnesses. results will be disseminated to scientists and forensic professionals through publications and presentations, thereby informing policies and guidelines for the use of remote forensic interviews with children. because remote interviewing increases access to specialized expertise, project results will also impact how children are questioned by electronic means in non-forensic contexts. the project will provide research training to dozens of students at two research sites and promote greater awareness of evidence-based practice through outreach to practitioners who work with child witnesses. using an established paradigm that produces salient touching experiences, individual children at two sites (ages 4 to 8 years) will be told that a male assistant can no longer touch their skin when he delivers a germ education program. the assistant will touch each child once and realize an impending mistake before he completes a second touch. afterward, children will hear a story from their parents that contains misinformation about the experience, including narrative about a nonexperienced touch. during interviews conducted in traditional face-to-face or remote formats, children will answer questions about the germ education event and answer a series of questions that tests their ability to distinguish experienced from suggested events. by comparing the completeness and accuracy of children?s testimonies across formats, this study will determine whether remote interviewing elicits testimony that is comparable in quality to the testimony elicited by face-to-face interviewing. measures of behavioral inhibition and executive function will determine whether remote interviewing is beneficial for children who are behaviorally inhibited or contraindicated for typically-developing children who have poor cognitive control."
SBP: Collaborative Research: Gender Discrimination in Hiring for STEM Graduates,"abstract this interdisciplinary project will use cutting-edge technology to study the labor market for computer science graduates in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (stem) fields. although women's share in stem employment has been growing in non-computer science occupations, their share in computer science occupations has been declining since the 1990s. because computer science occupations account for 50% of stem workers, this decline is slowing the growth of women?s share in stem fields overall, and suggests significant untapped potential that could improve us productivity and competitiveness. one reason that women may not seek out or remain in computer science fields is that they are treated differently than men during the hiring process. this project uses a laboratory experiment in the field on first-line hiring managers to determine first if there is differential treatment of women in hiring recent computer science graduates. if there is such a difference, it will determine the characteristics of women who are more likely to be treated negatively as well as general characteristics of firms that are more likely to exhibit differential treatment. resumes will be randomly generated to include different characteristics that, if their inclusion helps women more than men, will indicate potential reasons for this differential treatment. the experiment will also use eye-tracking to determine how recruiters visually process computer science resumes and whether or not there are differences between how they process male vs. female resumes. these combined results will help to differentiate between economic theories of discrimination, and will advance social science by increasing our theoretical understanding of when and how differential treatment occurs. results from this study can be used to make recommendations to individuals applying for these positions and institutions which advise them, to employers who desire to hire the best candidates, and to policy makers who want to increase meritocratic hiring in stem. the results will thus lead to a more diverse and competitive workforce, increasing the economic competitiveness of the u.s. this project combines two cutting-edge methodologies, eye-tracking and resume-randomization, to study gender discrimination at the first stage of the stem hiring process. it will determine if there is differential treatment by gender in how first-line hiring managers treat resumes, whether the treatment is similar or different along the applicant quality distribution, and if there are industry characteristics (ex. firm size, industry code) that would lead to higher or lower levels of differential treatment. finally, this study will differentiate between different theories of statistical and taste-based discrimination. technical recruiters in charge of first-line interview decisions will be solicited at university recruitment fairs and industry fairs to view and process hypothetical resumes for computer science majors. they will be asked to follow their standard hiring practice and to choose resumes to ?move to the next stage. the resumes will then be redisplayed and participants will rate each resume and give the expected starting salary and position. while participants are viewing the resumes, their eye-movements will be tracked via an eye-tracking device. following the resume rating exercise, they will answer a short demographic survey. resumes with randomized inputs based on actual resumes will be created via a randomization program. outcomes of interest include information on ratings, moving the resume to the next stage, position placement, salary ranges, time spent on individual resumes, time spent on and number of looks at specific parts of resumes. the coefficients and significance on the coefficient of gender determine whether or not there is differential treatment by gender, and if so, for which women and by what kinds of firms. time spent on resumes by gender interacted with differential treatment findings provide information on use of heuristics in the decision-making process. time spent viewing specific parts of the resume (areas of interest or aoi) and tracking the order that recruiters view parts of the resume provide insight into their decision-making processes. gender interactions with randomized inputs that support or contradict stereotypes will be used to test employee taste-based discrimination and levels-based statistical discrimination. position placement by gender will test customer taste-based discrimination. comparing predicted outcomes with actual outcomes by gender of resume be used to test variance-based statistical discrimination. this project directly impacts the full participation of women in stem and will (1) improve the well-being of individuals in society, (2) develop a diverse and competitive workforce and (3) increase economic competitiveness. results from this study can be used to make recommendations to individuals applying for these positions and the institutions who advise them, to employers who desire to hire the best candidates, and to policy makers who want more women and minorities in stem. the methodology will (4) promote future research on other hiring and discrimination questions. in addition, this project will (5) incorporate graduate and undergraduate students, involving them in cutting-edge research and providing them with a platform to undertake their own independent work. graduate and undergraduate students will receive mentoring and research skills, increasing their attractiveness to employers and advanced degree programs."
Collaborative Research: Understanding the productivity of the world's most numerous firms: evidence from surveys and satellites,"title: understanding the productivity of the world's most numerous firms: evidence from surveys and satellites why are some firms more productive than others? this has been a central question in economics for nearly a century, and its answer has implications for the long term well-being of societies, and for how government policy can promote this well-being. in this project we will study the most common firm type in the world: the family-owned farm. our research focuses on farms in africa, which employ a large share of the world?s poor. a detailed understanding the productivity of these firms -- whether and why some firms are more productive than others ? will help provide the foundation for designing policy interventions that could improve their overall productivity, and thus lift incomes for many of the world's poorest. working with us satellite companies, we will also generate new estimates of agricultural productivity based on satellite imagery, and make these data available to both researchers and policymakers. results from this research has policy implications for increasing the productivity of small businesses and thus reduce poverty throughout the world, including in the u.s. the goal of our proposed work is to characterize the size and sources of productivity dispersion across family owned farms, the most common firm type in the world and the employer of a majority of the world's poor. productivity dispersion has been well studied among firms in the developed world, but surprisingly little is known about the temporal and spatial patterns of productivity dispersion in poor countries. understanding the size and source of productivity gaps among agricultural firms -- previously difficult to study due to lack of data -- would fill a large gap in the existing productivity literature. we propose to make progress on this question by combining two newly-available sources of data: a growing set of high-quality household panel surveys currently underway by the world bank in multiple african countries, and brand-new high-resolution satellite-based estimates of land productivity in eastern africa. these two data sources, in combination, will allow us to evaluate for agricultural firms the stylized facts that have been established for manufacturing and retail firms: whether productivity dispersion across firms is large and persistent, whether firm entry and exit are correlated with productivity, and whether selective exit and entry are an important source of aggregate productivity growth within the agricultural sector. analysis will be conducted across nine african countries."
Collaborative Research: Market Based Emissions Policies,"abstract this project funds research that will evaluate how firms and consumers respond to market-based policies that are supposed to improve air quality and address environmental issues. the focus here is on testing hypotheses drawn from economic theory about how new environmental policies affect business and public health in the rapidly growing chinese economy. china is about to adopt a new national program of cap-and-trade emissions policies. the research team will collect innovative measures of pollution, firm outcomes, and individual health. they will analyze these data to test the team's hypotheses about whether or not these policies will achieve the stated goals. predicting and understanding the effects of these policies is important for many scientific reasons. what is more, the policies could potentially result in chinese manufacturers facing much higher costs of environmental compliance, which would have important implications for worldwide trade and the comparative advantage of manufacturers in countries such as the united states that already have strong environmental controls. this project therefore will provide valuable new evidence to researchers around the world and policymakers in the united states who are charged with promoting us economic competitiveness. the lack of reliable data are primary obstacles to understanding the world?s most ambitious market-based environmental policy using data from a recently implemented comprehensive cap and trade program. the project will evaluate how emissions, firm outcomes, and individual health respond to this signature environmental policy. first the team will conduct a conventional program evaluation of the country's seven carbon trading pilot programs that were launched in late 2013. this is analysis is already feasible using conventional empirical approaches, such as difference-in-differences analysis. second, they will extensive baseline measures for the 2017- launch of the national program as it comes online. third, they will collect and assess innovative pollution and health measures and evaluate the nation?s early experience with its incipient national program. the project emphasizes analysis of independent and objective metrics rather than official government measures. heterogeneity in the program features by regional market furnishes a laboratory for identifying successful and unsuccessful program features. rules governing the national program are currently being finalized and will be evaluated for the identification strategies they furnish."
Collaborative Research:  An Experimental Test of the Impacts of Transparency by Government,"this research project tests whether transparency by government leads to beneficial outcomes such as better performance by government, more engagement from citizens in public life, and improved trust in government. these kinds of outcomes are the reasons why so many countries, including the united states, have embraced transparency by government. yet, there is not much direct evidence that transparency efforts by governments produce the noted results. the project uses a randomized field experiment to test whether transparency by a government agency affects citizen support for government and improves the administration of public funds. data on these outcomes is used to statistically test for the effects of government-led transparency at individual and community levels. funding is for phase 1 only of the project."
